# Sourcing and Citation Guidelines

To ensure transparency and allow for easy verification of information, follow these guidelines when including data from external web sources.

## Guidelines

- **Provide URLs:** When information is derived from a specific webpage, provide the direct URL as a link or in a "Sources" section.
- **Easy Access:** Ensure the user can navigate to the source of the data easily.
- **Not a Hard Rule:** This is a strong recommendation for transparency, but not a strict requirement for every single statement if the source is general knowledge.
- **Format:** Use standard markdown link syntax: `[Title/Description](URL)`.

## Implementation
When summarizing search results or providing data on grant recipients, always aim to include the source links near the relevant information.
