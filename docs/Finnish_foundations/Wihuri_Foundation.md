# Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation: Funding Manual

**Relevance Score: 2/5 (Peripheral Match)**

---

## Executive Summary

The Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation is one of Finland's largest private foundations, established in 1942 by industrialist Antti Wihuri and his wife Jenny. With annual grant distributions exceeding €16 million (2025 record), the foundation supports a broad range of activities in science, art, and societal development. While it has a broad mandate that can fund interdisciplinary scientific work, it is not specifically focused on neuroscience, AI, or consciousness research, making it a peripheral match that requires strategic framing to align with the foundation's priorities.

## Strategic Fit for Neuroscience, AI, and Consciousness Research

### Relevance Score: 2/5 (Peripheral Match)

**Rationale:**
- The foundation has a broad mandate supporting general science, but no specific focus on neuroscience, AI, or consciousness
- Competition is high across all scientific fields
- Requires strategic framing to align with foundation priorities

### Potential Alignment Strategies

1. **Clinical Neuroscience Framing:**
   - Frame consciousness research through clinical neurology lens (similar to Sigrid Jusélius strategy)
   - Emphasize applications to brain health, mental health, or neurological disorders
   - Connect to Wihuri Research Institute's medical research focus

2. **Interdisciplinary Science Approach:**
   - Highlight multidisciplinary nature (science + technology + societal impact)
   - Emphasize potential for Finnish innovation and economic development
   - Connect AI/neuroscience to broader societal challenges

3. **Technology-Medicine Intersection:**
   - Frame as medical technology innovation (AI diagnostics, brain-computer interfaces)
   - Emphasize potential for commercialization or clinical translation
   - Align with foundation's support for technical sciences

4. **Societal Impact Narrative:**
   - Emphasize how consciousness research addresses mental health challenges
   - Connect to Finnish societal priorities (aging population, mental health)
   - Frame as contributing to "Finnish mental vitality" (core mission)

### Competitive Disadvantages

- **No Specific Field Focus:** Must compete with all scientific disciplines
- **High Competition:** As one of Finland's largest foundations, receives many applications
- **Broad Evaluation Criteria:** May be difficult to stand out without clear alignment with foundation's historical priorities

### When to Apply

- **Best For:** 
  - Large-scale interdisciplinary projects requiring substantial funding (€500k+)
  - Projects with clear societal impact and Finnish connection
  - Multi-year research initiatives that bridge science and technology
- **Not Ideal For:**
  - Small pilot studies (better suited for smaller, more specialized foundations)
  - Purely theoretical work without clear applications
  - Projects without strong Finnish connection
