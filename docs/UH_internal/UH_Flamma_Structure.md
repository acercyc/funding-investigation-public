# University of Helsinki: Research Funding Information Structure

This document outlines the organization and content of the research funding pages on the Flamma intranet (`/en/group/tutkimuksen-tuki/tutkimusrahoitus`).

## 1. High-Level Page Architecture
The funding pages follow a consistent three-column layout designed to balance navigation, core content, and support resources.

### Left Column: Navigation Tree
This is the primary way to explore different funding types. It is organized by the **source** of the funding:
*   **Research Funding Databases**: Tools for searching external grants.
*   **National Research Funding**:
    *   Research Council of Finland (formerly Academy of Finland)
    *   Business Finland
    *   Other National Research Funding
*   **International Research Funding**:
    *   EU Funding (Horizon Europe, etc.)
    *   US Funding
    *   Other International Funding
*   **Strategic Funding**: High-level institutional initiatives (e.g., Profi, HiLIFE).
*   **University of Helsinki's own research funding**:
    *   Additional funding for research 2024–2028
    *   Support for doctoral researchers
*   **Funding application app**: Direct link to the internal application system.

### Center Column: Core Information
This area contains the specific details for the selected topic.

#### **Landing Page Structure**
*   **Mission Statement**: Overview of Research Funding Services (RFS) and how they assist with proposals and negotiations.
*   **Campus-Specific Support**: Expandable sections (accordions) for **City Center, Kumpula, Meilahti, and Viikki**. This allows researchers to find help tailored to their specific faculty's location.

#### **Category Page Structure (e.g., National/International)**
Pages like "National Research Funding" or "International Research Funding" follow a standardized template:
1.  **Lead Paragraph**: Immediate instruction to contact local units, RFS, and Financial Services early.
2.  **Risk Assessment**: Mandatory reminder about risk assessments for international collaborations.
3.  **Funder Overviews**: Brief, structured paragraphs for major funding bodies (e.g., EU Framework Programmes, Research Council of Finland, Business Finland) providing a high-level summary of what they fund and how.
4.  **Application Links**: Links to external funder portals or internal instructions.

### Right Column: Support & Communication
Fixed resources that remain visible across most funding sub-pages:
*   **Contact Info**: Central email for Research Funding Services.
*   **Training & Events**: Links to materials and career-stage funding guides (PDFs).
*   **Newsletter**: Instructions for subscribing to the "researchservice-newsletter."

## 2. Information Available Per Page
Based on the structure, here is the type of information you can expect to find when navigating through the site:

### For Specific Funding Sources (e.g., EU Funding, RCF)
*   **Current Calls**: Lists of open and upcoming deadlines.
*   **Eligibility Rules**: Who can apply (career stage, affiliation).
*   **Submission Guidelines**: Step-by-step instructions on using the funder's portal.
*   **Internal Deadlines**: Many external grants require internal review before the official deadline.

### For University's Own Funding
*   **Strategic Objectives**: Why the university is offering this specific fund (e.g., profiling areas).
*   **Budget Templates**: Pre-filled or guided forms for university-specific overheads.
*   **Reporting Requirements**: How to report on the use of internal funds.

### For Campus Specialists
*   **Direct Contacts**: Names and roles of specialists assigned to your specific campus.
*   **Local Workshops**: Information on campus-specific training sessions.

## 3. Key Findings for Researchers
*   **Service-First Approach**: The site is structured as a "service" rather than just a list. It emphasizes *who* can help you (RFS) as much as *what* funds are available.
*   **Geographic Support**: If you are in Kumpula, you have a different support team than someone in Meilahti, which is reflected in the accordion structure.
*   **Role-Based Filtering**: The "Researcher" tab is the primary interface, ensuring that the information shown is relevant to academic staff rather than administrative or teaching-only staff.
