# **University of Helsinki Internal Research Funding Ecosystem: An Exhaustive Analysis of Strategic, Operational, and Endowment-Based Mechanisms**

## **Executive Summary**

The internal funding landscape at the University of Helsinki constitutes a sophisticated, multi-layered financial ecosystem designed to support the institution's strategic objective of maintaining its status as a world-class research university. Unlike a monolithic funding structure where resources are distributed solely through departmental allocations, the University of Helsinki operates a matrix of funding mechanisms that intertwines centralized strategic profiling, independent research institutes, library-managed infrastructure support, and a historic portfolio of endowment funds.

This comprehensive report analyzes these mechanisms in exhaustive detail. The analysis categorizes the internal funding architecture into four primary pillars: **Strategic Research Profiling**, driven largely by the national "Profi" instrument and channeled through high-level institutes like HiLIFE and HELSUS; **Researcher Career Lifecycle Support**, which encompasses a shift from stipends to salaried positions for doctoral researchers, alongside specific grants for mobility and dissertation completion; **The Open Science Infrastructure**, where the University Library acts as a major funding body for Article Processing Charges (APCs) through complex publisher agreements; and **Innovation and Commercialization**, which provides distinct "Proof of Concept" (PoC) funding to bridge the gap between academic discovery and market viability.

A critical insight emerging from this research is the university's strategic pivot regarding doctoral funding. There is a demonstrable transition from fragmented, small-scale stipends toward standardized, salaried employment relationships (the "tohtorikoulutettava" model). This shift aims to improve the socio-economic security of early-career researchers, although specific "gap-filling" instruments like the Dissertation Completion Grant and the Chancellor’s Travel Grant remain vital for addressing the non-linear nature of academic research timelines. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a dynamic and occasionally volatile funding environment, evidenced by the strategic suspension of certain internal funding streams within the Helsinki Institute of Sustainability Science (HELSUS) in 2024, highlighting the dependency of internal instruments on broader institutional budgetary decisions.

## ---

**1\. Strategic Research Profiling and the National Interface**

The University of Helsinki's internal funding strategy is inextricably linked to the Finnish national research policy framework, specifically the "Competitive funding to strengthen university research profiles" (Profi) instrument administered by the Research Council of Finland (RCF). While the source of these funds is external, their application and distribution within the university effectively function as a high-level internal allocation mechanism used to steer institutional strategy, recruit international talent, and reshape the university's research landscape.

### **1.1 The Profiling (Profi) Instrument as an Internal Lever**

The Profi instrument represents a move away from distributing resources based purely on historical size or student numbers. Instead, the university competes for a share of a national funding pool—amounting to between €50 million and €100 million across all Finnish universities per call—to support specific "profiling areas".1

#### **1.1.1 Mechanism of Allocation**

The Research Council of Finland does not fund individual research projects through Profi; rather, it funds the university's strategic plan. Once awarded, these funds are managed internally by the University of Helsinki to execute specific measures, primarily recruitment. The funding is fixed-term, typically spanning six years (e.g., Profi 8 covers 2025–2030), and is designed to speed up the development of chosen areas.2

A key characteristic of this funding is its focus on **recruitment-driven profiling**. For instance, the Profi 9 call, scheduled for decision in 2026, specifically targets the recruitment of international experts to career stages 3 (independent researcher) and 4 (professor).1 The university utilizes this capital to create internal "headhunting" budgets, allowing faculties and institutes to offer competitive packages to top-tier talent from abroad, particularly from regions like the United States.1

#### **1.1.2 Strategic Cycles and Financial Volume**

The university participates in biennial Profi cycles. The financial implications are significant; for a single successful recruitment under the Profi 9 scheme, the funding allocation can reach up to **€2.5 million** over five years.1 This allows the university to internally sub-allocate resources to specific units that align with the successful profile, effectively creating a "winner-takes-more" internal market that incentivizes units to align with central strategy.

| Profi Call | Funding Period | Strategic Focus | Internal Allocation Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Profi 8** | 2025–2030 | Strengthening existing/emerging areas | Internal allocation to specific research clusters 2 |
| **Profi 9** | 2026–2031 | International Recruitment (Tier 3-4) | Targeted recruitment packages up to €2.5M/researcher 3 |

The university’s ability to secure these funds depends on the quality of its strategic plan, which is evaluated by international panels. This external validation process forces the university to conduct rigorous internal reviews of its research quality, indirectly influencing internal budget decisions beyond the Profi funds themselves.2

### **1.2 The Matrix Structure: Institutes as Funding Hubs**

To operationalize this profiling strategy, the University of Helsinki has established independent institutes that function as cross-cutting funding hubs. These institutes—most notably the Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE) and the Helsinki Institute of Sustainability Science (HELSUS)—operate outside the traditional faculty structure, providing a matrix of internal funding opportunities that foster interdisciplinarity.

## ---

**2\. The Life Science Engine: Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE)**

HiLIFE serves as the premier example of the university's "institute model" of internal funding. It aggregates resources to support the life sciences ecosystem across multiple campuses (Meilahti, Viikki) and faculties (Medicine, Biological and Environmental Sciences, Pharmacy, Agriculture and Forestry, Veterinary Medicine). HiLIFE operates a suite of highly structured internal grant programs that mirror external competitive calls in their rigor and prestige.

### **2.1 The HiLIFE Fellows Program**

The HiLIFE Fellows Program is the flagship internal funding instrument designed to identify and support scientific excellence. It is not an open call for all staff but a competitive selection process that designates "Fellows" who receive both funding and community support.

#### **2.1.1 Selection Rigor and Demand**

The demand for this internal status is high. In the 2022 call, HiLIFE received **175 eligible applications**, representing a 14% increase compared to the previous call in 2017\.4 The applicants are categorized into three career stages to ensure fair competition:

* **Starting Researchers:** 23% of applications (in 2022).  
* **Consolidator Researchers:** 27% of applications.  
* **Advanced Researchers:** 50% of applications.4

The selection process utilizes a two-stage evaluation system involving an independent review panel and a second-stage international evaluation, underscoring the university's commitment to international standards even for internal resource distribution.4

#### **2.1.2 Financial Support Structure**

While up to 60 Fellows are selected based on scientific excellence, the financial component is reserved for a subset of approximately 35 Fellows. These funded Fellows receive up to **€50,000 per year for three years** (totaling €150,000).4

This funding is "curiosity-driven," meaning it is relatively unrestricted compared to specific project grants, intended to allow top researchers the flexibility to explore new avenues or bridge gaps between larger external grants. The program aims to build a community of expertise, with Fellows expected to participate in mentoring and program development.4

### **2.2 HiLIFE Tenure Track Positions**

Distinct from standard faculty appointments, HiLIFE manages its own tenure track lines. These positions are strategic tools used to recruit in specific high-priority areas, such as "future resilient crops" or "food and environmental toxicology".6

* **Joint Appointments:** These positions are shared between HiLIFE and a partner faculty (e.g., Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry or Veterinary Medicine). This requires a complex internal transfer of funds where HiLIFE likely covers the initial "startup" period or a portion of the salary, incentivizing faculties to participate in these strategic recruitments.6  
* **Startup Packages:** The recruitment offer includes an "attractive negotiable startup package," which is a critical form of internal funding that provides the equipment, personnel, and consumables necessary for a new professor to establish their laboratory.6  
* **Recruitment Cycle:** The university plans these calls in cycles, with the next major call for Assistant/Associate Professors planned for **2026**.6

### **2.3 Educational Integration: Research Trainee Scholarships**

HiLIFE also directs internal funds toward undergraduate education, specifically to integrate students into high-level research early in their careers.

* **HiLIFE Research Trainee Scholarships:** This program funds Bachelor’s and Master’s students for a three-month research training period.  
* **Financial Terms:** The scholarship provides approximately **€1,600 per month** for up to three months.7  
* **Mobility:** Uniquely, this internal fund supports mobility. Students can choose to work in research groups at the University of Helsinki or at other institutions in Finland or abroad. If the student goes abroad, the funding is handled via a University of Helsinki HR-issued grant, ensuring the student remains financially supported by their home institution while gaining international experience.7

**3\. Sustainability Science Funding: HELSUS**

The Helsinki Institute of Sustainability Science (HELSUS) operates as a parallel strategic entity to HiLIFE but focuses on the cross-disciplinary field of sustainability. Its internal funding mechanisms have been vital for building a cohesive community from the disparate faculties of Social Sciences, Law, Arts, Agriculture, and Science. However, recent developments highlight the vulnerability of these internal funds to broader budgetary constraints.

### **3.1 HELSUS Funding Instruments (2018–2023)**

For several years, HELSUS operated a robust portfolio of internal calls designed to seed new research and foster societal impact.

#### **3.1.1 Seed Funding**

This instrument provided small-scale grants (typically **€10,000 to €30,000**) to HELSUS members to launch new research initiatives.

* **Purpose:** To enhance the development of sustainability science and increase the potential for external funding.8  
* **Examples of Funded Projects:**  
  * *Adaptive futures for nomadic peoples (FACES)*: €19,500.  
  * *Normative Tools for Freight Transport Sustainability*: €30,000.  
  * *Ecological-Socio Risk Awareness*: €25,400.8  
* **Eligibility:** Restricted to HELSUS members from participating faculties who had no other available funding.8

#### **3.1.2 Societal Impact and Event Funding**

HELSUS specifically funded projects aiming to bridge the gap between academia and society.

* **Impact Funding:** Grants of roughly **€120,000** (often covering salary costs) were awarded for projects like "Global South Encounters" or "Just Sustainability for indigenous peoples".8  
* **Event Funding:** This smaller stream covered facility rents (specifically at the "Think Corner" / Tiedekulma) to allow researchers to host public-facing events. This was a direct internal subsidy to cover the internal rent charges levied by the university’s facilities management.9

#### **3.1.3 Postdoctoral Fellowships**

HELSUS used internal funds to recruit postdoctoral researchers for two-year terms. These were substantial awards (approx. **€110,000–€120,000**) intended to bring new talent into the institute.10

### **3.2 The 2024 Funding Restructuring**

A critical finding from the 2024 HELSUS Annual Report is the **discontinuation** of several key internal funding streams. The report notes that the deans of the participating faculties decided to discontinue the HELSUS postdoc, seed, and impact funding instruments.12

* **Implications:** This demonstrates that internal funding at the University of Helsinki is often contingent on the consensus of the "faculty deans," who control the core budgets. When budget pressures mount, cross-faculty institute funding can be vulnerable.  
* **Current Status:** As of late 2024/early 2025, HELSUS members are encouraged to seek external funding, with the internal "hub" space at Porthania also facing defunding.12 This marks a significant shift from the "expansion phase" of HELSUS (2018–2023) to a "consolidation phase."

**4\. The Doctoral Researcher Support Infrastructure**

The funding of doctoral education at the University of Helsinki has undergone a structural transformation. The university is systematically replacing the traditional model of "stipend-based" students with "employment-based" researchers. This section details the current hybrid landscape where salaried positions, completion grants, and specific expense subsidies coexist.

### **4.1 University-Funded Doctoral Researcher Positions (Salaried)**

The primary mechanism for internal doctoral funding is now the **Salaried Doctoral Researcher Position** (*tohtorikoulutettavan tehtävä*).

* **Nature of Support:** These are not grants but employment contracts. The doctoral researcher receives a salary, occupational health care, and accrues pension benefits—benefits not typically available to stipend recipients.13  
* **Allocation Process:**  
  * The university allocates funding for these positions to its **33 Doctoral Programs** (e.g., Doctoral Programme in Brain and Mind, Doctoral Programme in Political, Societal and Regional Change).13  
  * **Application Cycle:** The main call for applications typically occurs annually in the **autumn** (e.g., September), with employment starting the following January.13  
  * **Duration:** The objective is to fund the researcher for a period sufficient to complete the degree, typically targeted at **four years** of full-time work.13  
* **Selection:** The board of each doctoral program evaluates applications and makes recommendations to the faculty, which is the formal hiring authority. This decentralized selection ensures discipline-specific expertise governs the allocation.13

### **4.2 Helsinki University Science Foundation (Tiedesäätiö) Positions**

Working in tandem with the university's own budget is the **Helsinki University Science Foundation**.

* **Integration:** The Foundation funds **10 doctoral positions** annually. Crucially, applicants do not apply directly to the Foundation. Instead, the doctoral programs select their top candidates during the standard university call and forward these files to the Foundation for approval.13  
* **Strategic Criteria:** The Foundation evaluates candidates based on scientific excellence, interdisciplinarity, societal impact, and the feasibility of the research plan.13  
* **Volume:** In 2021, the funding for these 10 positions amounted to **€1.52 million** (covering 456 person-months), highlighting the significant cost per researcher when including salary and overheads.15

### **4.3 Dissertation Completion Grants ("Väitöskirjan viimeistelyapuraha")**

For doctoral candidates who exhaust their primary funding (salaried or external) before submission, the university ecosystem provides specific "finishing" or "completion" grants. These are critical safety nets.

* **Providers:** These grants are often managed by affiliated foundations such as the **Walter Ahlström Foundation** and the **Paavo Koistinen Foundation**, which operate in close connection with the university’s research community.  
* **Grant Sizes:**  
  * *Walter Ahlström Foundation:* Awards typically **€4,000** for completion work.16  
  * *Paavo Koistinen Foundation:* Awards can be higher, with data showing grants of **€10,000** for completion.18  
* **Purpose:** The funds are strictly earmarked for the "finalization of the dissertation" (*väitöskirjan viimeistely*), bridging the gap between the end of a 4-year contract and the public defense.16  
* **Future Trends:** There is a documented discourse within the university community (specifically in the Faculty of Medicine context) regarding plans to convert these completion grants into short-term (e.g., 3-month) salaried relationships. This "employment-based completion" model aims to prevent researchers from falling out of the social security system right before graduation.20

### **4.4 The Chancellor’s Travel Grant (Kanslerin matka-apuraha)**

The Chancellor’s Travel Grant is one of the university’s oldest and most widely recognized internal funding instruments for mobility.

* **Target Audience:** Primarily doctoral researchers.21  
* **Purpose:** To cover the costs of foreign travel for academic purposes, such as conference presentations, data collection, or short research visits.  
* **Financial Scope:** The grants are generally modest, designed to cover specific travel expenses rather than living costs. Historical and recent recipients report amounts ranging from **€800 to €1,600** depending on the destination (Europe vs. Global).23  
* **Governance:** The funds are discretionary funds at the disposal of the Chancellor, distinct from the Rector's operating budget. Applications are handled via the university's internal system (Flamma).27

### **4.5 Dissertation Printing Grants**

The university subsidizes the final, mandatory step of the doctoral degree: the publication of the thesis.

* **The Subsidy:** The university offers a **printing grant** that covers the cost of a **black-and-white edition of 20 copies**, including a color cover page.28  
* **Vendor Lock-in:** To access this grant, the candidate *must* use **Unigrafia**, the university-affiliated printing house. The university pays Unigrafia directly, removing the candidate from the payment flow for the subsidized portion.28  
* **Open Access Condition:** The grant is conditional. The candidate must agree to publish the dissertation digitally in the **Helda** open repository. If a candidate applies for an exemption from digital publication (e.g., for commercial reasons), they **forfeit** the printing grant and must pay the full cost themselves.28  
* **Limitations:** The grant does not cover layout services, color images inside the book, or extra copies. These costs must be borne by the candidate or their department.28

## ---

**5\. The Open Science Infrastructure: Library as Funder**

A massive, often overlooked component of internal funding is the budget allocated by the Helsinki University Library to cover Open Access (OA) publishing costs. As the academic publishing model shifts from "Pay to Read" (subscriptions) to "Pay to Publish" (APCs), the library has effectively become a funding agency for researchers.

### **5.1 The Author Fee Service and Centralized APC Payment**

The University of Helsinki has centralized the payment of Article Processing Charges (APCs) to remove the financial burden from individual research projects.

* **Eligibility Criteria:**  
  1. The **corresponding author** must have a valid affiliation with the University of Helsinki.  
  2. The author must use their helsinki.fi email address for submission and correspondence.  
  3. The article must be published under a **CC BY** license (Plan S compliant).29

### **5.2 Publisher Agreements and Quotas**

The library manages "Read & Publish" agreements with major publishers. These agreements essentially prepay the APCs for university researchers. However, these funds are finite and often subject to annual quotas.

**Table 2: Key Publisher Agreements and Terms (2024–2026)**

| Publisher | Validity Period | Coverage Details | Constraints/Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Elsevier** | 2024–2026 | Free OA in hybrid journals; 15% discount in Full OA journals. | Covers full length articles, reviews, case reports. |
| **Springer Nature** | 2024–2025 | Free OA in hybrid journals. | **Nature-branded titles are excluded.** Quota for 2025 was filled early. |
| **Wiley** | 2025–2026 | Free OA publishing. | Covers Research & Review articles. |
| **ACS (Chemistry)** | 2025–2026 | Free OA publishing. | **2025 Quota already filled.** |
| **Taylor & Francis** | 2025–2026 | Free OA within quota. | Requires helsinki.fi email. |
| **IEEE** | 2024–2025 | Free OA within quota. | Applies to articles accepted during contract period. |
| **SAGE** | 2025–2026 | Free OA publishing. | Includes original research, reviews, case reports. |
| **Cambridge UP** | 2024–2025 | Free OA within quota. | Includes research, case reports, brief reports. |

29

### **5.3 Gap Funding for Full Open Access Journals**

Because the "Read & Publish" agreements often favor hybrid journals (subscription journals that offer an OA option), the university has established a separate internal fund to support publishing in **Full Open Access** journals (Gold OA) that are not covered by these agreements.

* **Funding Limit:** Up to **€3,500 per article**.  
* **Cap:** A maximum of **six articles** per calendar year per corresponding author.  
* **Quality Control:** The journal must have a **JUFO (Publication Forum) rating of 1–3**. This quality filter prevents university funds from flowing to predatory publishers.29

## ---

**6\. Innovation and Commercialization Funding**

To bridge the "valley of death" between academic research and commercial viability, the University of Helsinki utilizes internal funds to de-risk technologies before they attract external investment. This ecosystem is managed by **Helsinki Innovation Services (HIS)**.

### **6.1 Helsinki Innovation Services (HIS) Support**

HIS acts as the gatekeeper and facilitator for commercialization. While it does not always provide cash grants directly, it funds the *process* of commercialization, covering the costs of:

* Invention Disclosure evaluation.  
* IPR protection (patenting costs).  
* Market analysis and business strategy development.30

### **6.2 HiLIFE Proof of Concept (HiPOC) Grants**

The HiPOC grant is a specialized internal funding instrument for life science researchers. It is explicitly designed to increase the value of university-owned IPR.

#### **6.2.1 Funding Categories**

1. **Category 1: Idea Maturation (Max €30,000)**  
   * *Target:* Researchers with a concept that is not yet an invention.  
   * *Goal:* To generate data that supports the submission of an **Invention Disclosure (ID)** after one year.32  
2. **Category 2: Invention Maturation (Max €50,000)**  
   * *Target:* Projects with an existing Invention Disclosure where the IPR is owned by the university.  
   * *Goal:* To perform Proof-of-Concept experiments, prototype development, or verify commercial potential.32

#### **6.2.2 Utilization Rules**

* **Commercialization Spend:** A unique requirement of HiPOC is that approximately **20% of the funding** should be allocated to commercialization costs, such as patent attorneys, business consultants, or market research. This forces researchers to think beyond the bench.32  
* **Restrictions:** Funds cannot be used for the applicant's own salary but can cover staff, equipment (up to €9,999), and reagents. The funding must be used within the university; it cannot be transferred to a spin-out company directly.32

## ---

**7\. The Endowment Funds ("Rahastot")**

The "Funds of the University of Helsinki" (*Helsingin yliopiston rahastot*) represent a distinct financial pillar. These are over 350 named funds established through donations over centuries. They are legally managed by the university group but are kept separate from the operating budget, with their capital invested to generate returns for distribution.

### **7.1 Governance and Distribution Principles**

* **Capital:** As of recent reports, the group manages investment assets exceeding €640 million, with the endowment funds constituting a significant portion.33  
* **Distribution:** The funds typically distribute an annual sum corresponding to **3% of their value**. This ensures intergenerational equity—preserving the real value of the capital while providing a steady stream of grants.33  
* **Decision Making:** Distribution decisions are generally made by the administrative committees of the specific funds or faculties, not centrally by the Rector.33

### **7.2 Notable Discipline-Specific Funds**

The funds are highly granular, often tied to specific disciplines based on the donor's wishes.

* **Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry:** manages 18 named funds with a capital of €1.4 million (2019 data).34  
* **Biological and Environmental Sciences:** manages 7 named funds, including the *Harry Federley Fund* and *Societas pro Fauna et Flora Fennica* funds.34  
* **The Valo Fund:** A specialized fund established in 2005 to support student mental health. It grants over **€50,000 annually** to the Finnish Student Health Service (FSHS) to provide extended psychotherapy for students, covering sessions that exceed the Kela (Social Insurance Institution) limits.35

## ---

**8\. Conclusion**

The internal funding ecosystem at the University of Helsinki is characterized by a high degree of **strategic dirigisme** blended with **legacy support structures**.

1. **Strategic Concentration:** Through the Profi and HiLIFE/HELSUS mechanisms, the university has successfully created large internal funding pools that are used to steer the institution toward specific strategic areas (Life Sciences, Sustainability) and to recruit international talent. This is a top-down, competitive internal market.  
2. **Professionalization of Research:** The shift in doctoral funding from stipends to salaried positions, supported by foundation partnerships (Tiedesäätiö), reflects a modernizing agenda that views doctoral researchers as employees with rights, rather than students with grants.  
3. **Infrastructure as Funding:** A significant portion of "funding" is now invisible to the researcher in the form of cash transfers but visible as service credits—specifically the centralized payment of Open Access fees and printing costs. This reduces administrative friction and ensures compliance with open science mandates.  
4. **Innovation Pipeline:** The existence of HiPOC and the integrated support of HIS indicates that the university views commercialization not as an afterthought but as a fundable stage of research, allocating specific internal capital to bridge the gap between the lab and the startup ecosystem.

This multi-faceted structure ensures that while the university relies heavily on external funding (RCF, EU), it retains powerful internal levers to shape its destiny, support its community, and bridge the gaps that external funders often leave behind.
