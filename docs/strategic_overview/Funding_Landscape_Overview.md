## Recommendations for University of Helsinki Researchers

- **Leverage national and Nordic foundations** for core research and early group leadership (Kone, Erkko, Jusélius, Finnish Brain Foundation).
- **Target niche global calls** (Tiny Blue Dot, Bial, Templeton, Fetzer) for consciousness and non-materialist neuroscience.
- **Utilize Business Finland and Horizon Europe** for tech/innovation and commercialization at the AI-neuro interface.
- **Engage with ERC and FENS** for European-scale, high-impact research and networking.
- **Monitor social media and foundation updates** for underutilized and early-career opportunities.

This funding landscape is dynamic—timely monitoring of foundation websites and participation in relevant academic networks is essential for maximizing success in 2025–2026.
