### Strategic Funding Analysis for Consciousness Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Neuroscience in the Finnish and Global Context: 2025-2026

##### Introduction: Navigating the Convergence of Mind, Machine, and Matter

The intersection of consciousness science, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience constitutes a complex and highly competitive frontier of modern research. This report provides a detailed strategic analysis of the tiered funding ecosystem for a researcher based at the University of Helsinki, mapping the critical opportunities across Finnish, European, and global platforms. The 2025–2026 period is particularly critical, marked by the final phases of the Horizon Europe programme, a pronounced European focus on human-centric AI, and a notable rise in private international funding dedicated to the kind of high-risk, high-reward research into the fundamental nature of consciousness that traditional public bodies often view as too speculative.

#### 1.0 The Finnish Funding Bedrock: National Philanthropy and Public Instruments

For a University of Helsinki researcher operating at the nexus of neuroscience and AI, Finland's national funding bodies represent the essential strategic foundation. These organizations provide the stable, long-term capital necessary to build a resilient research programme and de-risk the pursuit of more ambitious international grants. They form a financial "safety net" that enables researchers to pursue the bold, and at times unconventional, scientific questions that drive foundational progress in these highly competitive fields.

##### 1.1 Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation (JAES)

The Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation (JAES) is a premier source of substantial, multi-year funding in Finland. Its scientific grants are primarily aimed at research groups and postdoctoral researchers at all career stages, though it does not fund individual doctoral dissertations. The foundation’s emphasis on projects with clearly defined objectives and a "realistic implementation plan" exemplifies the "impact" side of the modern funding dual mandate, demanding a clear pathway from research to measurable outcomes.The application process is rigorous and follows a structured six-stage evaluation:

1. **Office Preparation:**  An initial check to ensure the application complies with the foundation's rules.  
2. **Two-Stage Expert Evaluation:**  An in-depth assessment by external experts based on established evaluation criteria.  
3. **Examination by the Expert Committee:**  A review by the foundation's dedicated committee.  
4. **Executive Committee Proposal:**  The Executive Committee formulates a funding proposal for the Board.  
5. **Board of Trustees Decision:**  The final decision on grant awards is made by the Board.  
6. **Notification to Applicants:**  All applicants are informed of the decision.Applications for medical research are considered at the Board's meetings in March and September.| Application Component | Key Requirements || \------ | \------ || **Work Plan** | Maximum 8 pages, including references. Must describe the project implementation concretely, concisely, and comprehensibly. || **Curriculum Vitae** | Maximum 3 pages for the group leader, following the Finnish National Board on Research Integrity (TENK) format. || **Publication List** | The 10 most relevant publications for the proposed project from the group leader. |

As a concrete example of the foundation's investment scale, a research group led by Associate Professor Isaac Afara at the University of Eastern Finland was awarded €1.57 million for a project in medical engineering aimed at growing personalized cartilage tissue.

##### 1.2 Kone Foundation

The Kone Foundation distinguishes itself with a unique mission rooted in fostering free and multi-voiced art and research. Its core values directly shape its funding preferences, favoring projects that are experimental, unhurried, and challenge established norms.

* **Diversity:**  A commitment to a multiplicity of voices and perspectives in nature, language, and society.  
* **Boldness:**  An encouragement of experimentation, multidisciplinary approaches, and the courage to cross boundaries between art and research.  
* **Perseverance:**  An appreciation for in-depth, unhurried work that allows for deep understanding to develop over time.  
* **Sense of community:**  A belief that boldness is powered by dialogue, encounters, and collaboration.These values translate into a funding strategy that supports unconventional and socially aware projects. Illustrating this focus, themes from the 2025 grant call included " **Spheres of Security** ," " **Our Shared Memory** ," and " **Situated Futures** ." For a researcher at the intersection of mind and machine, these themes offer avenues to frame research on AI ethics within "Spheres of Security," or to explore computational models of memory under "Our Shared Memory."

##### 1.3 Other Key Finnish Foundations

The Finnish funding landscape is further enriched by several other key players. The  **Finnish Cultural Foundation (SKR)**  supports a broad range of activities in science, art, and culture. Its largest and most competitive application period is the October round, running from October 10th to 31st.Dedicated exclusively to supporting medical research, the  **Sigrid Jusélius Foundation**  offers a diverse portfolio of grants tailored to different career stages, organized by distinct application periods for 2025:

* **Application Period: September 15–October 15**  
* **Fellowship (1–3 years):**  For postdoctoral researchers conducting medical research abroad.  
* **Senior Fellowship (6–12 months):**  For senior-level researchers conducting medical research abroad.  
* **Senior Researcher (4 years):**  For adjunct professors or equivalent researchers.  
* **Application Period: November 1–November 30**  
* **1–3-year grants:**  For senior researchers and young group leaders.

##### 1.4 Research Council of Finland (RCF)

The Research Council of Finland (RCF) stands as the country's primary public funding instrument for scientific inquiry. The RCF's budget is set to increase significantly in 2026, with over 600 million euros to be distributed, reflecting a national commitment to strengthening Finland's R\&D landscape.A central tenet of the RCF's strategy is a firm commitment to open science, underscored by its participation in the "Declaration for Open Science and Research 2020–2025" and the international cOAlition S initiative. This translates into stringent requirements for grantees, most notably the mandate for a comprehensive data management plan. By default, all research data and materials produced with RCF funding must be made openly available to promote transparency and reuse.While this stable national environment provides the ideal platform for building a research portfolio, a strategic shift is required to engage with the EU-level, impact-driven consortia that define the next tier of funding.

#### 2.0 The European Horizon: Collaborative and AI-Focused Programmes

Engaging with European Union funding mechanisms represents a strategic pivot from independent national projects to large-scale, cross-border consortia. For a researcher in AI and neuroscience, these programmes offer unparalleled opportunities to join international collaborations focused on leveraging advanced technologies to solve major health challenges, a commitment powerfully demonstrated by flagship projects such as the Virtual Human Twin initiative.

##### 2.1 Horizon Europe and the European Partnership for Brain Health

Horizon Europe remains the EU's key funding programme for research and innovation, and the draft Work Programmes for 2026–2027 are now available, offering an early look at upcoming opportunities. A significant development in this landscape is the upcoming  **European Partnership for Brain Health** . According to Dr. Ulrike Bußhoff, coordinator of the preparatory CSA BrainHealth project, this large-scale endeavor will unite stakeholders, pool resources, and accelerate progress in brain research and care. The CSA BrainHealth project itself has received funding from the Horizon Europe programme under grant agreement No 101136302, signaling strong institutional support for this initiative.

##### 2.2 The Virtual Human Twin (VHT) Initiative

The European Virtual Human Twins (VHT) Initiative is a flagship programme under the EU's Apply AI strategy, representing a major investment in the future of personalized medicine. A VHT is defined as a digital representation of a human health or disease state, built from software models and data to mimic and predict the behavior of its physical counterpart.This technology holds transformative potential. As highlighted by Professor Mikael Bensor and Professor Frank E. Rademakers, VHTs can revolutionize drug development, enhance clinical trials (especially for rare diseases), and help shift the focus of healthcare from cure to prevention. The European Commission has invested over EUR 100 million in the initiative and kickstarted the development of an advanced digital platform for VHT models on June 26, 2025\. This platform will provide access to supercomputing capacities and facilitate collaborative research across the EU.While the EU's focus on applied AI for health outcomes provides a clear path for impact-driven research, a different set of opportunities exists for tackling the more fundamental, philosophical questions about mind and reality funded by global private foundations.

#### 3.0 Global Frontiers: Private Foundations for High-Risk, High-Reward Research

Distinct from public bodies, international private foundations are uniquely positioned to support the speculative, "high-risk, high-reward" research essential for breakthroughs in fundamental science. For a researcher in AI-driven neuroscience, a strategic pivot to these philosophically-oriented foundations is a move to secure funding for the foundational questions that underpin their applied work. These organizations often fund inquiry into the nature of consciousness and reality, topics frequently considered outside the scope of traditional funding, thereby opening doors for truly paradigm-shifting work.

##### 3.1 Tiny Blue Dot Foundation: The Science of the "Perception Box"

The Tiny Blue Dot Foundation has a highly specific mission: to fund neuroscientific research aimed at understanding and measuring the "Perception Box"—a conceptual framework for an individual's unique subjective experience. The foundation supports the development of techniques and interventions to expand this perceptual framework and track their basis in the brain.| Call Stage | Deadline Date | Core Requirements & Funding || \------ | \------ | \------ || Letter of Intent (LOI) | Oct 7, 2025 | 300-500 word summary justifying the research's "foundational" and "topical" nature. || Full Proposal Submission | Mar 2, 2026 | Detailed plan for a neuroscientific intervention and tracking its basis in the brain. || Funding Details |  | Up to $900,000 for three consecutive years. Final funding decisions are made in June 2026\. |

##### 3.2 Templeton Foundations & Center for Open Science (COS): Rigor in Consciousness Research

The partnership between the Templeton World Charity Foundation (TWCF) and the Center for Open Science (COS) aims to inject exceptional methodological rigor into consciousness research, directly addressing the "rigor" side of the dual funding mandate. Their joint initiative funds projects that use the  **Registered Reports**  model, a publication format designed to combat bias and enhance reproducibility. This approach reflects the foundation's commitment to resolving fundamental questions, exemplified by its funding of a historic contest between two prominent theories of consciousness. The contest was modeled on the famous 1919 Eddington experiment that tested Einstein's theory of relativity against Newtonian gravity, demonstrating a commitment to decisive, empirically grounded inquiry.

##### 3.3 Fetzer Franklin Fund: A Relational View of Reality

The Fetzer Franklin Fund supports research at the intersection of science and philosophy, with a specific focus on "integrated and relational" views of reality. The fund encourages exploration of non-conventional causality that goes beyond a purely "bottom-up" physicalist position, where consciousness is seen as merely an epiphenomenon of brain processes. It actively supports scientific investigations into whether fundamental phenomena—including matter, life, and mind—exist primarily as a function of "being relational."

##### 3.4 Mind & Life Institute: Contemplative Science

The Mind & Life Institute offers grants dedicated to contemplative science. A key distinction is between the  **Mind & Life Varela Grants**  (associated with the US-based Summer Research Institute) and the  **European Varela Awards (EVA)**  (associated with the European Summer Research Institute). A critical eligibility requirement for both is that applicants must have attended their respective Summer Research Institute (SRI or ESRI) within the last five years. The next US SRI is scheduled for June 2026, with applications opening from December 2, 2025, to January 27, 2026.Securing funding from this diverse array of sources requires not only a compelling research vision but also strict adherence to emerging standards of research practice.

#### 4.0 Navigating the Methodological Mandates: Open Science and Research Integrity

The modern funding landscape is increasingly defined by a dual mandate: funders demand not only groundbreaking ideas but also exceptional methodological rigor and transparency. Mastering the principles of open science and research integrity is no longer optional for applicants but has become a prerequisite for success across national, European, and global funding bodies.

##### 4.1 Open Science and FAIR Data

Funders like the Research Council of Finland mandate a clear commitment to Open Science principles. This commitment must be demonstrated through concrete practices outlined in funding applications.

* **Open Availability:**  By default, all research data, materials, code, and software produced with RCF funding must be made openly available for reuse.  
* **Data Management Plans:**  A formal plan detailing how data will be managed, stored, and shared is a required component of all funding applications.  
* **Licensing:**  Data and software should be made available under permissive licenses like Creative Commons, GNU, or MIT to facilitate reuse.  
* **Metadata:**  If sensitive data cannot be fully opened, its metadata must still be stored in a findable Finnish or international repository to ensure its discovery.These practices align with the globally recognized  **FAIR**  data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). These principles are strongly promoted by organizations like the International Brain Initiative (IBI) as a foundational framework for enabling ethical, cross-border data governance and sharing in neuroscience.

##### 4.2 The Rise of Registered Reports

The Registered Reports model is a publication format designed to improve the quality and credibility of scientific research. In this model, peer review occurs  *before*  data are collected and results are known. Manuscripts are evaluated based on the importance of the research question and the methodological rigor of the proposed experimental design. This approach is explicitly promoted and funded by the Center for Open Science, in partnership with the Templeton World Charity Foundation, for consciousness research as a powerful tool to combat publication bias and improve the reproducibility of findings.These methodological principles are not abstract ideals but concrete requirements that must be integrated into a researcher's strategic funding plan.

#### 5.0 Strategic Roadmap for a University of Helsinki Researcher (2025-2026)

The preceding analysis can be synthesized into an actionable, multi-tiered strategy for a researcher at the University of Helsinki. This roadmap is designed to leverage the stability of national funding while strategically targeting high-value international opportunities in consciousness science, AI, and neuroscience.

##### 5.1 Tier 1: Immediate Independent Support (Postdoctoral / Junior Faculty)

This tier focuses on securing grants that build a researcher's independent profile and provide crucial career development opportunities.

* **Mind & Life Varela Grants:**  A key career development grant for researchers in contemplative science. A prerequisite is attending a Summer Research Institute.  *Applications for the next US SRI (June 2026\) are open from Dec 2, 2025, to Jan 27, 2026\.*  
* **European Varela Awards (EVA):**  A similar opportunity (up to €23,500) specifically for those who have attended the European Summer Research Institute (ESRI).

##### 5.2 Tier 2: Securing Foundational Group Funding (Mid-Career / Group Leader)

This tier targets larger, multi-year grants necessary to establish and sustain a research group and pursue more ambitious scientific goals.

* **Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation (JAES):**  Position this as the primary target for substantial, multi-year funding for a research group, particularly for projects at the intersection of medicine and technology that demonstrate clear impact.  *Medicine applications are reviewed in March and September.*  
* **Kone Foundation:**  Identify this as an ideal source for bold, multidisciplinary projects that may not fit traditional funding molds due to their experimental or unconventional nature.  *Main call is in September.*  
* **Tiny Blue Dot Foundation:**  Characterize this as a high-value international grant for targeted, high-risk neuroscientific research on consciousness and perception. Emphasize the two-stage application process to maximize efficiency.  *LOI Deadline: Oct 7, 2025\.*This tiered approach provides a clear framework for building a sustainable and ambitious research program.

#### 6.0 Conclusion: The Dual Mandate of Rigor and Impact

The 2025–2026 funding landscape for research at the intersection of consciousness, AI, and neuroscience is defined by a clear dual mandate. Success is no longer contingent on innovative ideas alone; it equally demands extreme methodological rigor—evidenced through commitments to Open Science and formats like Registered Reports—and clearly articulated pathways to societal or scientific impact. For a Finnish researcher, navigating this complex environment depends on a multi-tiered strategy that skillfully combines the stability of national foundations with the transformative potential of specialized global philanthropy. By mastering both the science and the strategy, researchers can secure the resources needed to explore the deepest questions of mind and machine.
