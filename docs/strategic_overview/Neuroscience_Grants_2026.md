# **Strategic Funding Roadmap 2026-2027: Integrating Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, and Consciousness Science for the University of Helsinki Ecosystem**

## **1\. Executive Intelligence and Strategic Framework**

The convergence of neuroscience, artificial intelligence (AI), and consciousness science represents one of the most intellectually volatile and financially promising frontiers in modern research. For a principal investigator or senior researcher domiciled at the University of Helsinki (UH), the funding landscape for the 2026-2027 biennium presents a unique paradox. On one hand, the "poly-crisis" affecting the global economy has led to a tightening of generalist public coffers; on the other, the existential questions posed by the rapid advancement of Generative AI and the burgeoning mental health crisis have triggered a "gold rush" of targeted funding in specific, high-impact niches.

This report serves as a comprehensive, strategic dossier designed to guide a Finnish researcher through this complex terrain. The analysis indicates that a singular reliance on traditional funding mechanisms—such as the Research Council of Finland (formerly Academy of Finland)—is no longer sufficient for sustaining a high-velocity research program at this intersection. Instead, a successful strategy requires a "portfolio approach" that leverages the high-autonomy domestic foundation ecosystem, the massive consortium-based machinery of Horizon Europe, and the niche, high-risk philanthropy of US-based "Big Question" funders.

The strategic horizon for 2026 is dominated by three meta-trends derived from the analyzed data. First, the European Union is aggressively pivoting from "Brain Research" to "Brain Health," a semantic shift that carries profound funding implications, prioritizing resilience, prevention, and societal impact over pure mechanistic mapping. Second, the "AI Safety" and "Human-Centric AI" narratives have permeated almost every digital funding call, creating a lucrative opening for consciousness researchers who can frame their work as investigating the boundaries of machine agency and human cognitive liberty. Third, the domestic Finnish landscape remains a bastion of "unconventional" science, where the Kone Foundation and the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation continue to fund high-risk theoretical work that would likely be rejected by peer review panels in more risk-averse nations.

The following analysis dissects these opportunities with granular precision, moving from the stable bedrock of Finnish foundations to the high-stakes arena of global consciousness philanthropy and European innovation actions.

## ---

**2\. The Domestic Bedrock: Finnish 'Hidden Gem' Foundations**

For a researcher at the University of Helsinki, the domestic private foundation ecosystem offers a competitive advantage that is virtually unmatched globally. Unlike the hyper-competitive federal funding systems in the United States or the United Kingdom, Finnish foundations operate with a degree of autonomy and tax-free beneficence that allows for genuine "blue-sky" inquiry. The 2026 cycles for these foundations are showing distinct evolutionary traits, moving away from purely disciplinary calls towards "multi-voiced" and "impact-oriented" frameworks.

### **2.1 The Kone Foundation: Championing the "Bold" and "Multi-Voiced"**

The Kone Foundation (Koneen Säätiö) stands as the premier entity for research that defies categorization. While many funders pay lip service to interdisciplinarity, the Kone Foundation mandates it as a core operational philosophy. For a researcher blending the "hard" science of neurobiology with the "soft" problems of consciousness and the computational rigor of AI, Kone is the most culturally aligned partner in Finland.

#### **Operational Philosophy and 2026 Priorities**

The Foundation’s strategic directive is to create conditions for "free and multi-voiced art and research".1 This "multi-voiced" criterion is not merely a buzzword; it is a selection filter. A successful proposal in 2026 will not simply apply AI to neuroscience data. It will likely need to integrate a third dimension—perhaps investigating the *societal* implications of machine consciousness or employing *artistic research* methods to visualize the phenomenology of perception. The Foundation explicitly supports research in humanities, social sciences, and environmental sciences, but its definition of "environmental" and "humanities" is sufficiently elastic to include the philosophy of mind and cognitive ecology.1

A critical nuance for the 2026 cycle is the continued presence of the "Metsän puolella" (For the Woods) thematic call alongside the general call. While the general call remains the primary vehicle for neuroscience, researchers should be astute in identifying if their work touches upon "environmental neuroscience" or "ecological consciousness." If a project investigates how natural environments affect brain states using AI-driven biometrics, it might find a less crowded corridor in the thematic call.3

#### **The Annual Cycle and Submission Dynamics**

The Kone Foundation operates on a rigid, predictable annual cycle. The general funding call for 2026 will open on **September 1, 2026** and close strictly on **September 15, 2026, at 16:00 EEST**.1 This deadline is immutable. The application system typically opens in late August, but the drafting process should begin months in advance.

Decisions are announced in early December, with funding available to start from January of the following year.1 This rapid turnaround—less than three months from submission to decision—is significantly faster than the Academy of Finland or Horizon Europe, making Kone an excellent source for "bridge funding" or launching pilot phases of high-risk projects.

#### **The Saari Residence: A Strategic Entry Point**

The analysis highlights the **Saari Residence** as a strategic "foot in the door." This residency program (application window **March 1–31, 2026**) offers individual researchers or working groups a two-to-four-week stay at the Saari Manor in Mynämäki.6 For a consciousness research group, this is an ideal venue for a "theory retreat"—a dedicated period to hammer out the conceptual framework of a larger grant proposal. Furthermore, securing a Saari residency signals to the Foundation that the researcher is part of their ecosystem, potentially adding weight to subsequent research grant applications.

**Actionable Insight for UH Researchers:**

* **Narrative Strategy:** Do not write a standard technical grant. Use the "Description" field to tell a compelling story about *why* this intersection of AI and Consciousness matters to the human condition.  
* **Consortiums:** The foundation values "Working Groups." A proposal from a solo neuroscientist is weaker than one from a group comprising a neuroscientist, an AI ethicist, and a philosopher.5  
* **Budgeting:** Kone grants are tax-free. Monthly grants for 2026 are likely to align with the 2025 rates (approx. €2,600 \- €3,800/month depending on experience), plus expenses. Ensure the budget includes costs for "Open Access" and "Public Outreach," as these are highly valued.5

### **2.2 The Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation: Scaling Ambition**

If the Kone Foundation is the home of the "unconventional," the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation is the engine of "excellence." This foundation is the primary domestic target for high-capital neuroscience projects requiring expensive equipment, extensive international collaboration, or large-scale data acquisition.

#### **Strategic Alignment: Technology and Medicine**

The foundation’s primary goal is to promote high-level research in **technology, economics, and medicine**.7 This tripartite focus makes it uniquely suited for the AI-Neuroscience interface. A project that uses *technology* (AI/Machine Learning) to advance *medicine* (Neurology/Psychiatry) fits their mandate perfectly. Unlike Kone, which tolerates "fuzziness," Erkko demands rigorous, internationally significant science with clear breakthrough potential.7

#### **The Continuous Submission Advantage**

A distinct operational advantage of the Erkko Foundation is its **continuous application process**. There are no fixed deadlines; electronic applications are accepted every day of the year.8 However, this "rolling" nature should not be mistaken for "rapid." The Board meets periodically to decide on grants, and the internal review process can be lengthy due to the use of international peer reviewers.

#### **Future Outlook: 2026 Priorities**

For 2026, the foundation has signaled a continued interest in **interdisciplinary** projects and those that support **young talent** and **internationalization**.9 They are "positively disposed toward joint projects in different fields," which directly supports a UH-led consortium blending the Department of Computer Science (AI) and the Faculty of Medicine (Neuroscience).10 Recent large grants (e.g., €9 million) demonstrate their capacity to fund center-scale initiatives.11

**Actionable Insight for UH Researchers:**

* **Ambition Level:** Do not ask for small "seed" money here. Erkko is the place to apply for a 3-5 year, €500k+ project that aims to solve a major problem (e.g., "A unified theory of consciousness for clinical diagnostics").  
* **Timing:** While the call is continuous, submitting in **late August or early January** can align well with the start of academic terms and board meeting cycles.  
* **International Anchor:** Include a strong international partner (e.g., a co-PI from MIT or Oxford). This satisfies their "internationalization" criterion and validates the "excellence" of the proposal.

### **2.3 The Finnish Cultural Foundation (SKR): Regional vs. Central Strategy**

The Finnish Cultural Foundation (Suomen Kulttuurirahasto) operates a sophisticated dual-layer system. Navigating the distinction between the **Central Fund** and the **Regional Funds** is critical for optimizing success rates.

#### **The Central Fund: The October Juggernaut**

The main application period for the Central Fund is **October 10–31, 2026**.12 This round is highly competitive and funds science, art, and culture.

* **Eminentia Grants:** These are intended for senior researchers for a year of reflection and writing. For a senior researcher at UH looking to write a seminal book on "The Consciousness of AI," this is the specific instrument to target.13  
* **Additional Million-Euro Funding:** Each year, SKR designates themes for large-scale "spearhead" funding. In previous years, topics have ranged from "Argumenta" to medical themes. It is vital to monitor the 2026 announcements in August/September to see if a "Brain Health" or "AI & Society" theme emerges, as this would be a jackpot opportunity.13

#### **The Regional Funds: The January Opportunity**

The Regional Funds operate on a separate cycle, with the application window open from **January 21 to February 6, 2026**.12 For a UH researcher, the **Uusimaa Regional Fund** is the target.

* **Strategic Fit:** Regional funds often receive fewer high-level scientific applications compared to the Central Fund. A project that emphasizes *local impact*—for example, "Studying the impact of digital addiction on the brains of Helsinki teenagers"—could be extremely competitive here.  
* **Science/Art Interface:** The Uusimaa fund has historically had a strong arts focus, but recent rounds have included "Art Together" and grants for projects combining science and art.14 This is an excellent avenue for "Sci-Art" consciousness exhibits or public engagement projects.

**Actionable Insight for UH Researchers:**

* **Double Dipping:** You can theoretically apply to both the Central Fund (October) and Regional Fund (January) if the projects are distinct or if the Central application was unsuccessful (though you must disclose other pending applications).  
* **Grant Types:** Prioritize "Working Grants" for doctoral/post-doctoral team members and "Expenditure Grants" for lab costs.

### **2.4 The Sigrid Jusélius Foundation: The Clinical Gatekeeper**

The Sigrid Jusélius Foundation is the financial backbone of non-governmental medical research in Finland. Its resources are vast, but its scope is strictly defined: **medical research**.

#### **The "Translation" Imperative**

A UH researcher working on "AI and Consciousness" faces a binary outcome here: rejection if the project is framed as "basic cognitive science" or "AI development," and acceptance if framed as "**clinical neuroscience**." The proposal *must* articulate a pathway to patient benefit.

* *Bad Framing:* "Investigating the neural correlates of machine consciousness."  
* *Good Framing:* "Utilizing AI-driven neural correlates of consciousness to improve diagnostic accuracy in comatose and vegetative state patients."

#### **Grant Cycles and Categories**

* **1-3 Year Grants:** This is the core project funding. The application period is **November 1 – November 30, 2025** (for funding starting May 2026).15 This cycle is critical for sustaining lab operations.  
* **Senior Researcher / Clinical Researcher Posts:** These cover the salary of the PI. The deadline is earlier, typically **September 15 – October 15, 2025**.16  
* **Visiting Professor Grants:** An excellent tool to bring a global consciousness expert (e.g., from the Fetzer or Templeton networks) to Helsinki for 3-12 months. Deadline: **Nov 1-30**.18

#### **The Finnish Advantage**

A crucial detail is the foundation's statute that **at least 75% of grants must be awarded to Finnish researchers** or research conducted in Finland.17 This protectionist clause significantly increases the probability of success for a UH applicant compared to open international calls.

**Table 1: Strategic Matrix of Finnish Foundations (2025-2026 Cycles)**

| Foundation | Application Window | Key Strategic Focus | Ideal Project Type |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Kone Foundation** | Sep 1–15, 2026 | Bold, Multi-voiced, Unconventional | Interdisciplinary (Art+Neuro+AI), Theoretical, Environmental Consciousness |
| **Jane & Aatos Erkko** | Continuous (Rolling) | Excellence, Tech, Medicine | High-Cost Equipment, International Consortia, Medical AI |
| **Finnish Cultural (SKR)** | Oct 10–31 (Central) Jan 21–Feb 6 (Regional) | Culture, Science, Regional Impact | Senior Sabbaticals (Eminentia), Localized Cohort Studies (Uusimaa) |
| **Sigrid Jusélius** | Nov 1–30 (Project) Sep 15–Oct 15 (Post) | Strictly Medical / Clinical | Clinical Neurology, Disorders of Consciousness, biomarkers |

**3\. The Global Consciousness Niche: "Big Questions" and Adversarial Collaboration**

Beyond the borders of Finland, the funding landscape for consciousness science is dominated by a select group of philanthropic organizations dedicated to the "Big Questions" that public agencies often deem too speculative. These funders are actively moving towards "Adversarial Collaboration" models—funding rival labs to test conflicting theories—creating a high-stakes, high-reward environment.

### **3.1 Templeton World Charity Foundation (TWCF) & John Templeton Foundation (JTF)**

The Templeton philanthropies are the heavyweights of consciousness funding. Their strategy has shifted from scattershot grants to focused "Grand Challenges" and "Adversarial Collaborations."

#### **Templeton World Charity Foundation (TWCF)**

TWCF is distinct from JTF and has been the primary driver of the "Accelerating Research on Consciousness" initiative.

* **Current Themes:** The foundation is currently prioritizing **"Human Flourishing,"** **"Life Sciences"** (specifically the meaning of life processes and biological agency), and **"Intelligence"**.19  
* **The Intelligence Link:** A recent specific interest has been the question: *"What constitutes intelligence?"*.21 This is a direct bridge for AI researchers. A proposal exploring the "divergence between artificial intelligence and biological sentience" aligns perfectly with this theme.  
* **2026 Cycle:** The **Online Funding Inquiry (OFI)** is the mandatory first step.  
  * **OFI Deadline:** **August 14, 2026**.22  
  * **Full Proposal (Invite Only):** **January 15, 2027**.22  
* **Fellowships:** TWCF also runs a fellowship program (deadlines often in **March**) which is an excellent vehicle for mid-career researchers to pivot into consciousness studies.21

#### **John Templeton Foundation (JTF)**

JTF funds "Big Questions" in science, philosophy, and theology.

* **Strategic Angle:** JTF is more open to the theological/philosophical implications of neuroscience. If the UH researcher works with the Faculty of Theology or Philosophy, a joint proposal on "The implications of AI consciousness for human spiritual identity" would be strong.  
* **Process:** Similar OFI process to TWCF, usually with an August deadline.

### **3.2 The Tiny Blue Dot Foundation: The "Perception Box"**

The Tiny Blue Dot Foundation is a niche but highly relevant funder for this specific user persona. Their mandate is singular: understanding and expanding "The Perception Box"—the biological and cognitive limits of human experience.

#### **Thematic Alignment: AI and Interventions**

Tiny Blue Dot is explicitly interested in **neuroscience-based interventions**. They fund research involving mindfulness, psychedelics, and, crucially, **technologies such as AI and VR**.23 This is a "bullseye" for the AI & Neuroscience interface. They want to know: *Can AI be used to measure or expand the Perception Box?*

#### **The 2025-2026 Timeline**

The foundation operates a precise Request for Proposals (RFP) cycle.

* **LOI Window:** Opens **September 2, 2025**, and closes **October 7, 2025**.24  
* **Full Proposal:** Invited applicants submit by **February/March 2026**.23  
* **Funding Scale:** Grants are substantial, up to **$900,000** over three years. This level of funding is comparable to a major Academy of Finland project but with a much narrower, more philosophical focus.23

**Actionable Insight:** The LOI is short but critical. It must use the "Perception Box" terminology. Do not write about "cognitive bias"; write about "Perception Box constraints." The foundation is looking for measurable, scalable interventions, not just theory.

### **3.3 The Bial Foundation: The Psychophysiology Niche**

Based in Portugal, the Bial Foundation is one of the few global entities that explicitly funds **Psychophysiology** and **Parapsychology**.

#### **The "Healthy Human" Focus**

Unlike Jusélius or Horizon Health, Bial is interested in the *healthy* human brain, not just pathology. This allows for basic research into altered states of consciousness, meditation, and exceptional human experiences.26

#### **The 2026/2027 Call**

Bial operates on a biennial (two-year) cycle for its "Grants for Scientific Research."

* **Next Cycle:** The **2026/2027** call is expected to open in **April 2026** with a deadline in **August 2026**.27  
* **Funding:** Grants are capped at **€60,000**. While smaller, they are excellent for high-risk pilot studies—for example, testing a radical hypothesis about "quantum consciousness" or "non-local consciousness" using rigorous EEG protocols.29

### **3.4 The Fetzer Franklin Fund: Physics and Metascience**

Fetzer operates at the bleeding edge of physics and biology, often funding work that challenges materialist reductionism.

* **Focus:** "Agency," "Free Will," and "Metascience." They are interested in whether physics allows for genuine agency, a question central to both consciousness and AI safety.  
* **Engagement:** Fetzer often does not have a standard "open call" portal. They operate through partnerships (e.g., with FQXi \- Foundational Questions Institute) or **Letters of Inquiry**. Monitoring their news for "RFP announcements" in **late 2025/early 2026** is the strategy.30

## ---

**4\. The European Engine: Horizon Europe (2026-2027)**

For a researcher at UH, the European Union's Horizon Europe framework is the engine for large-scale, collaborative research. The **2026-2027 Work Programmes** are currently being drafted, and the intelligence gathered indicates a massive pivot towards **Brain Health** and **Human-Centric AI**.

### **4.1 Cluster 1: Health – The "Brain Health" Revolution**

The most significant development for 2026 is the launch of the **European Partnership for Brain Health (EP BrainHealth)**. This partnership replaces the previous NEURON and JPND networks and will mobilize hundreds of millions of euros.

#### **EP BrainHealth Joint Transnational Calls (JTC) 2026**

* **Launch Date:** The partnership is scheduled to launch its first calls on **January 8, 2026**.32  
* **Call Topics:**  
  * **Call 1:** "Neurological, Mental, and Sensory Disorders." This is broad enough to include computational models of mental health.  
  * **Call 2:** "Neurodegenerative Disorders".34  
* **Deadline:** Pre-proposals are expected to be due **March 10, 2026**.33  
* **Strategic Action:** This funding *requires* a transnational consortium. A UH researcher cannot apply alone. The strategy is to leverage UH’s existing networks (e.g., Neurocenter Finland) to join a consortium with partners in Germany (DLR), France (ANR), or Norway (RCN) immediately.

#### **Specific Horizon Europe Calls (Mental Health & Digital Tech)**

Beyond the partnership, the main Work Programme for Cluster 1 contains a specific topic of immense relevance:

* **Topic:** **HORIZON-HLTH-2026-01-DISEASE-02**: "Innovative interventions to prevent the harmful effects of using digital technologies on the mental health of children and young adults."  
* **Deadline:** **April 16, 2026**.35  
* **Relevance:** This call bridges the "AI & Neuroscience" gap. A project proposing to use AI to detect early signs of "digital burnout" or using neuro-feedback to protect youth mental health would be highly competitive.

### **4.2 Cluster 4: Digital, Industry, and Space – "Human-Centric AI"**

The narrative in Cluster 4 has shifted from "AI Performance" to "AI Trustworthiness" and "Human-Centricity."

* **Human-Centric AI Call:** **HORIZON-CL4-2026-01-DIGITAL-EMERGING-52** ("New approaches for Human/AI collaboration...") is expected to open in late 2025/early 2026\.36  
* **AI for Science:** A pilot action **HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01** focuses on applying AI foundation models to scientific discovery.37 If the researcher uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze neuro-data or simulate cognitive processes, this is the correct vehicle.

## ---

**5\. The Innovation Interface: Business Finland**

For research that has the potential to generate tools, software, or therapies, Business Finland offers the critical "Research to Business" (R2B) funding.

### **5.1 Research to Business (R2B) Spring 2026**

* **Purpose:** To prepare a research idea for commercialization (e.g., spinning out a startup).  
* **Timeline:** The Spring 2026 call will open in **January 2026** and close in **early March 2026 (approx. March 5\)**.38  
* **Financials:** Business Finland covers **80%** of the project costs (typically a total budget of €300k–€700k).  
* **The Constraint:** **40% of the budget** must be allocated to "commercialization preparation" (market analysis, IP protection, team building).39 This prohibits spending the entire grant on wet-lab research.  
* **UH Support:** The University of Helsinki’s **Helsinki Innovation Services (HIS)** is a mandatory partner in this process. Researchers *must* engage HIS early (Nov/Dec 2025\) to perform the required "Innovation Disclosure" and market assessment before the BF application.39

## ---

**6\. Social Media Reconnaissance & "Hidden" Opportunities**

Scanning the "long tail" of funding reveals opportunities often missed by standard searches.

### **6.1 The Olav Thon Foundation (Norway)**

This is a massive "hidden gem" for Nordic researchers.

* **Scope:** Grants for **Nordic collaboration in medicine**.  
* **Deadline:** **October 15, 2025** (for 2026 funding).41  
* **Grant Size:** Highly significant (millions of NOK).  
* **Strategy:** Requires a consortium with Norwegian/Swedish partners. A "Nordic Brain Health" alliance is the winning formula here.

### **6.2 VolkswagenStiftung (Germany)**

While German-based, this foundation funds international "Change Agents."

* **"Change\!" Fellowships:** The next deadline is expected in the **2nd half of 2026**. This program funds research on "Societal Transformations," perfect for the "AI Ethics/Consciousness" angle.43  
* **"Experiment\!":** For radically risky ideas that defy classification.

### **6.3 University of Helsinki Internal Funds**

* **UH Funds:** Small grants for travel/materials. Application: **Jan 14 – Feb 6, 2026**.44  
* **HSSH Catalyst Grant:** For Social Sciences/Humanities research groups. Deadline: **September 1, 2025** (for 2026).45 This is crucial for funding the *interdisciplinary* meetings required to build a larger Kone or Horizon consortium.

## ---

**7\. Strategic Synthesis & Action Plan**

### **7.1 The "Portfolio" Strategy**

The researcher should adopt a diversified submission strategy to mitigate the risk of rejection.

**Table 2: 12-Month Action Plan (Q4 2025 – Q3 2026\)**

| Phase | Timeframe | Primary Target | Action Required |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **I. The Intervention** | **Sept-Oct 2025** | **Tiny Blue Dot Foundation** | Submit LOI by **Oct 7**. Frame research as "Mapping the Perception Box with AI." |
| **II. The Nordic Medical** | **Oct-Nov 2025** | **Olav Thon** & **Sigrid Jusélius** | Submit Nordic collab (Oct 15\) and UH medical project (Nov 30). Focus: "Clinical biomarkers." |
| **III. The Commercial** | **Jan-Feb 2026** | **Business Finland R2B** | Engage HIS in Jan. Submit R2B by **March 5**. Focus: "AI-Neuro Diagnostic Tool." |
| **IV. The Euro-Consortium** | **Jan-Mar 2026** | **Horizon (EP BrainHealth)** | **CRITICAL:** Pre-proposal due **Mar 10**. Secure EU partners by Dec 2025\. |
| **V. The Theoretical** | **Aug-Sept 2026** | **Templeton** & **Kone** | Submit OFI to Templeton (Aug 14\) and Main Call to Kone (Sept 15). Focus: "The Philosophy of Machine Minds." |

### **7.2 Final Recommendation**

The critical path for 2026 lies in **European Collaboration**. The launch of the **EP BrainHealth Partnership** is a once-in-a-decade structural shift. While Finnish foundations provide excellent individual stability, the scale of data and funding required for breakthrough AI-Neuroscience research necessitates joining a European consortium. The researcher should immediately leverage their UH affiliation to signal interest in the BrainHealth calls, using the HSSH Catalyst Grant (Sept 2025\) to fund the initial network-building meetings.
