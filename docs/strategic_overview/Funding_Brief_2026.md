# Strategic Funding Analysis: Neuroscience, AI, & Consciousness Applications (2026)

**Prepared For:** Senior Researcher, University of Helsinki  
**Date:** December 19, 2025  
**Subject:** Comprehensive Funding Roadmap (2025-2026)

## 1. Executive Summary

This report outlines high-impact funding opportunities tailored to a researcher at the intersection of **Neuroscience, AI, and Consciousness**. 

The funding landscape for 2026 is characterized by a strong pivot toward **"Human-Centric AI"** in Europe and **empirical consciousness research** in the global private sector. 

**Critical Immediate Target:** The Business Finland **"Research to Business"** call closes on **March 4, 2026**. This is the premier opportunity to commercialize applied AI/Neuro technologies.

## 3. Global "Niche" Funding (Consciousness Specific)
*Private foundations explicitly funding non-materialist or expanded views of consciousness. Finnish researchers are eligible.*

| Foundation | Focus | Funding / Deadline Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tiny Blue Dot Foundation** | **The Perception Box**; Empirical neuroscience of expanded perception. | **Eligible.** Awards up to **$900k**. Highly rigorous, empirical focus. |
| **Templeton World Charity** | **Fellowships**; "What constitutes intelligence?"; Accelerated Consciousness Research. | **Deadline:** typically **March** (Est. March 2026). Distinct from John Templeton Foundation. |
| **Bial Foundation** (Portugal) | **Psychophysiology & Parapsychology**. | **Biennial.** Next major deadline expected **August 2026**. (2024/25 round closed Aug 2024). |
| **Fetzer Franklin Fund** | **Physics, Biology & Consciousness**; Relational reality. | **Invite-Only / Partnership.** Do not submit unsolicited proposals. Focus on networking at "Science of Consciousness" events. |
