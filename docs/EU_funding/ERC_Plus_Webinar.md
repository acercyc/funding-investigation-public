## Complete Q&A Section

The following questions and answers were addressed during the webinar and in the follow-up Q&A document.

### Eligibility Questions

**Q: Those who had a MSCA can apply or is it considered as an ex-ERC grant recipient?**

A: ERC Plus is open to researchers at any career stage with an outstanding record of scientific achievement; there is no restriction related to having held a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship, and Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship are not considered as ex-ERC grant recipient. ERC Plus is also not defined as a follow-up scheme for previous ERC grantees.

**Q: How many years post-PhD can one apply?**

A: There is no limit on years post-PhD. Applicants at all career stages may apply, provided they demonstrate outstanding scientific achievement and intellectual leadership.

**Q: Will applicants from Associated Countries e.g., UK be eligible, as per other ERC schemes?**

A: Yes. Host Institutions may be located in EU Member States or in countries associated to Horizon Europe - therefore including applicants hosted by UK institutions. Applicants may reside anywhere in the world at the time of application.

**Q: If failed the ERC Starting Grant 2026, can we apply the ERC Plus in 2026?**

A: No, you can only apply to one call for each work programme. Therefore if you applied to Starting 2026, you cannot also apply to ERC PLUS 2026 unless you decide to withdraw your Starting grant proposal respecting the rules on withdrawals.

**Q: I don't understand the restriction related to B/C result of Starting, Consolidator or Advanced Grant. If these proposals are rejected, why are these researchers not applicable for ERC+?**

A: This is because if these applicants were not considered to fulfill the excellence criterion for their application to Starting, Consolidator and Advanced Grant they will most likely not be competitive for the ERC Plus call.

### Evaluation Process Questions

**Q: What will be the exact criteria of evaluation for the 2 Steps?**

A: The evaluation will follow two steps. Step 1 will be conducted by Advanced Grant panels, who will assess mainly the groundbreaking idea of the project, the vision statement and the past achievements and intellectual leadership of the PI. Step 2 written assessment will be performed by panel members, with the support of remote reviewers. In Step 2 the reviewers will assess all aspects considered in Step 1, with the addition of details of methodology and resources. The Step 2 panels will also interview the applicants. The specific evaluation questions for each step will be listed in the amended ERC workprogramme 2026.

**Q: When will you contact panel members? How big will the panels be?**

A: The ERC Scientific Council will soon start nominating the ERC Plus panel members. The ERC Plus step 2 panels will be created based on an expected selection of approximately 60 panel members.

**Q: First review is by existing Advanced Grant panels which are a particular organisation of existing fields. What about projects that do not fit in an existing panel?**

A: Step 1 evaluations will be conducted by Advanced Grant panels; as for other ERC calls the panels will be able to ask for cross panel reviews if additional expertise is needed to evaluate a step 1 ERC Plus proposal.

**Q: At the first stage you compete against people from your field, the top proposals from each field are picked, and at the second stage generalists select 30?**

A: At Step 1, applicants are evaluated along applicants in the same field. The Advanced panel members will pick the best ERC Plus applications to go to the next step, without any quota per field or upper limit. In Step 2, interdisciplinary/generalists panel will make the final decision among proposals in all fields. They will be supported by specialist reviews provided by remote referees.

**Q: Panels will meet for Advanced Grant and in another session for ERC Plus?**

A: Advanced Grant 2026 and ERC Plus 2026 are two separate calls, and although the Advanced Grant panel members will evaluate the applications of both calls, this will be done in two separate sessions.

**Q: Will the same parts of the proposal be available to the panel members at the 2 steps like for other schemes? at step 1 Advanced Grant panel members will only have access to Part 1?**

A: In step 1 only Part 1 of each proposal will be evaluated. The Vision Statement in Part 1 will be evaluated in both Step 1 and Step 2. In step 2 all evaluators will assess the full proposal (Parts 1 and 2).

**Q: Which materials will be evaluated in each evaluation step?**

A: In step 1 only the Part 1 of each proposal will be evaluated. The Vision Statement in Part 1 will be evaluated in both Step 1 and Step 2. In step 2 all evaluators will assess the full proposal (Parts 1 and 2).

**Q: Will the application form still be divided in part B1 and B2 and how does this relate to the new evaluation process?**

A: In step 1 only the Part 1 of each proposal will be evaluated. The Vision Statement in Part 1 will be evaluated in both Step 1 and Step 2. In step 2 all evaluators will assess the full proposal (Parts 1 and 2).

**Q: Is feedback provided, besides pass, no pass?**

A: Step 1 will lead to a retained/not-retained decision and applicants will also receive a panel comment together with all step 1 individual reviews as part of their final feedback if not retained to step 2.

**Q: How will you manage panel overload? Especially considering recent increase in submissions. Any possibility for increased budgets?**

A: The overall call budget is expected to be EUR 210 million with no or only limited possibility for an increased budget. The Scientific Council is currently discussing mitigation measures for the recent high increase of proposals submitted to all ERC call. These will also be in place for ERC Plus.

**Q: Do you think it would be useful to blind some applicant information in order to minimise any potential review bias?**

A: This is not foreseen.

### Application Process Questions

**Q: How much equivalent full-time will be necessary to write such grant application? For regular ones it is close to a couple months.**

A: This is up to each applicant. The proposal template will be similar to the templates for Starting, Consolidator and Advanced grant except their will be an additional section in Part 1 dediated to the Statement of Vision, which should not exceed two pages.

**Q: Will the templates be the same? And what is planned for the reports?**

A: Applicants will use downloadable templates provided on the Funding and Tenders portal. The feedback to applicants will follow the same structure as for other ERC calls (all individual reviews and a panel comment summarising the final decision of the panel).

**Q: So when submitting an ERC plus grant, you need to submit to a single ERC AdG panel, as per usual ERC grant applications?**

A: Yes. Step 1 evaluations will be carried out by Advanced Grant 2026 panels and hence each applicant should select a primary panel to review their proposal in step 1 following the 2026 ERC panel structure.

### Budget and Funding Questions

**Q: What would the overheads be for the host institution?**

A: Budgets should include eligible direct project costs plus a flat rate of 25% of the direct costs, which covers overheads for the Host Institution.

**Q: If the goal of the project fails, will there be cuts in the budget by the end of the project?**

A: There will be the same level of flexibility in the project implementation as for any other ERC grant. The PI may ask for an amendment if they find they need to change the scientific approach substantially during the project. The payment will be done for the work performed - and not based on whether a project was succesful or failed to produce the expected outcome.

### Scope and Objectives Questions

**Q: Is there an appetite for practical solutions? Innovative and ambitious, but practical.**

A: The scheme targets projects that go beyond regular ERC grants, with a vision to transform a field or open new avenues in research, which may also include proposals in applied sciences.

**Q: What kind of objectives will be positively evaluated? A new tool? A new methodology?**

A: Positively evaluated projects should go beyond regular ERC projects and have a vision to transform a field or open new research avenues.

**Q: ERC grants often require clear theoretical contribution. Does the Plus expect that as well? Or does it have a broader scope, e.g. for someone to make a tool?**

A: ERC Plus supports projects that go beyond regular ERC grants and aim to transform a field or open new avenues in research. Applications can be of both theoretical or applied nature.

**Q: Does impact matter at all?**

A: Projects should address a major scientific challenge and aim to transform a field or open new research avenues; this implies a strong emphasis on scientific impact, but impact per se will not be part of the evaluation questions.

**Q: You mentioned the possibility of proposing clinical studies. Would these include experimental evidence up to the first-in-human? Mainly advanced therapies?**

A: ERC Plus supports projects that go beyond regular ERC grants and aim to transform a field or open new avenues in research. Applications can be of both theoretical or applied nature.

**Q: If the 'wow effect' is the same, are Europe-focused projects given priority over globally focused ones?**

A: No preference is stated regarding the geographical focus of the research content, provided the Host Institution is in an EU Member State or Associated Country and other eligibility conditions are met.

### Host Institution Questions

**Q: Are the eligible location criteria the same as for other ERC grants?**

A: Yes. The Host Institution must be located in an EU Member State or a country associated to Horizon Europe. Additionally, the Principal Investigator must spend at least 50% of their working time in EU Member States or countries associated to Horizon Europe.

**Q: Can only university host the ERC Plus grantee? Cannot Research Institutes host?**

A: Host Institutions can be public or private research organisations located in EU Member States or associated countries; they are not limited to universities.

**Q: Can an application have more than one host institution?**

A: Grants are signed with the single Host Institution of the PI, but a PI is allowed to have multiple affiliations.

**Q: How do you check under lump sum if someone spends their 50% in Europe over 7 years?**

A: We ask a written declaration of honour co-signed by the PI and a host institution representative. The ERCEA scientific officers follow the progress of the projects and, in case of doubts, additional proof that the place commitment is respected may be requested and/or visits to the project organised.

### Career and Team Questions

**Q: How will the career history be balanced against the proposal structure and the team one is proposing to assemble?**

A: Applicants must show an outstanding record of scientific achievement and intellectual leadership, assessed relative to their career stage; the team composition should consider the activities proposed for the project.

### Confidentiality and Individual Projects

**Q: How does the ERC guarantee the confidentiality of exciting ideas? Are they individual projects like the Advanced Grants?**

A: The ERC have strict rules on confidentiality that needs to be observed by all experts. The same rules regarding confidentiality will apply to ERC Plus as for other ERC grant evaluations. ERC Plus are individual grants like the Advanced Grants.

### Collaborators

**Q: Are private actors, media institutions, eligible as collaborators?**

A: Yes.

### Timeline and Calls

**Q: So, there will be only 1 single call in September 2026 or there will be a second call in September 2027?**

A: Yes - While the ERC 2027 work programme still needs to be fully finalised and approved - this is currently what is expected.

**Q: How many calls there will be the coming years?**

A: ERC Plus will be piloted for two years, in 2026 and 2027.

### Synergy Grant Comparison

**Q: ERC Synergy 2026 will have 5% success rate, the lowest rate in years. Why exclude multiple PIs in the ERC Plus?**

A: ERC Plus is designed for single-Principal-Investigator projects. Multiple-PI applications are not foreseen.

### Future of ERC Schemes

**Q: ERC Plus seems to be a pilot project. Do you plan to drop segregation to Starting, Consolidator and Advanced Grant in the close future?**

A: No. This is not foreseen.

### Funding Source

**Q: This will become elite grant for those who have enough money already but it is about their prestige to get it. Why not to increase amount of current ERC per project.**

A: This call will be financed from additional funding that the European Commission has generously provided specifically for this purpose. Therefore, using these funds for other calls would not be possible. But even if it were, precisely because the number of grants is so small, spreading the funding across the nearly 100 other peer review panels that select our other grants would have only a negligible impact on the success rates there. This grant competition is open to everyone, whether from Europe or the US or anywhere else in the world. It will be a competition at high level, but with a level playing field.

### Predictions

**Q: Have you done any estimation/prediction about the number proposals that will be submitted to the 2026 ERC Plus call?**

A: No
