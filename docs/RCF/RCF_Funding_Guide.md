A successful RCF application is not only scientifically excellent but also meticulously aligned with the Council's unified framework of procedures and principles. This framework is designed to ensure transparency, integrity, and equity, with a steadfast commitment to responsible science that forms the bedrock of the RCF's funding philosophy. A failure to address these principles is not a minor oversight but a critical flaw that can render an application ineligible.

###### *4.1 The Application Lifecycle*

The typical timeline for a major RCF call, such as the winter call, follows a structured annual cycle that provides applicants with a clear and predictable schedule.

1. **Preparation and Submission:**  Applicants draft their research plan, CV, and other mandatory appendices, submitting the complete application via the RCF's online portal. The typical submission window for the winter call is mid-October to mid-November (e.g., 15 October – 12 November 2025).  
2. **Commitment by Site of Research:**  Following the application deadline, the applicant's host institution must provide its formal commitment to co-fund and support the project. This is typically required within 14 days of the call deadline.  
3. **Review and Decision:**  Applications undergo a rigorous, multi-month international peer review. Based on these expert evaluations, the relevant scientific councils make the final funding decisions, usually in the following June (e.g., June 2026).  
4. **Funding Commencement:**  The funding period for successful projects officially begins on a fixed date, typically at the start of the academic year (e.g., 1 September 2026).

###### *4.2 Peer Review Process and Criteria*

The RCF employs a two-stage peer review process to ensure that only the most scientifically meritorious applications are funded. Initially, each application receives at least two individual reviews from international experts. Applications that receive a final rating of 5 (excellent) or 6 (outstanding) in at least one individual review will proceed to the second stage: a full review by an expert panel, which discusses and ranks the top applications.The evaluation is guided by fundamental review criteria, including:

* The scientific quality, novelty, and innovation of the research.  
* The feasibility of the research plan.  
* The competence and expertise of the applicant and/or research team.

###### *4.3 Principles of Responsible Researcher Evaluation*

The RCF is a signatory to the  **San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA)**  and a member of the  **Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA)** . These commitments translate into a responsible evaluation process guided by core principles that reviewers must follow:

* Assessment is based  **primarily**  on  **qualitative evaluation** , with peer review being the central element.  
* The use of  **journal-based metrics** , such as the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) or the h-index, as a surrogate measure of the quality of individual research articles is strictly prohibited.  
* Reviewers must  **recognize a diversity of contributions**  to research, not limited to publications alone.  
* The use of  **rankings of research organizations**  in the assessment of applications should be avoided.

###### *4.4 Core Requirements for Responsible Science*

Applicants are required to embed the principles of responsible science directly into their research proposals. Several components are mandatory and must be addressed for an application to be considered.

* **Open Science:**  Applicants must describe their adherence to open access publication principles (Plan S) and detail a plan for the responsible management and, where possible, open sharing of research data.  
* **Research Ethics:**  All proposed research must follow the ethical guidelines established by the Finnish Advisory Board on Research Integrity.  
* **Equality and Non-discrimination:**  The research plan must outline how the project will promote these principles, both in the composition and management of the research team and within the research itself.  
* **Research Security:**  A mandatory self-assessment appendix must be included. This requires applicants to identify and plan for potential risks related to international cooperation, dual-use technology (potential for both civilian and military applications), and research in critical technology areas.These principles are not mere formalities; they are integral to the RCF's identity and its role as a steward of publicly funded research.
