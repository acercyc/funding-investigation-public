# **Strategic Funding Roadmap for Consciousness Science, Information Theory, and Artificial Intelligence: A Comprehensive Analysis for the University of Helsinki**

## **1\. Introduction: The Convergence of Consciousness Science and Funding Strategy**

The scientific landscape for consciousness research is currently undergoing a profound transformation, shifting from a niche philosophical interest to a central pillar of diverse fields ranging from computational neuroscience to artificial intelligence safety. For a new Principal Investigator (PI) at the University of Helsinki, specifically one with the profile of Dr. Acer Chang—whose work bridges **Information Closure Theory (ICT)**, **neuroimaging**, and **agentic AI**—this shift presents a unique constellation of funding opportunities. The traditional boundaries between "blue-sky" theoretical physics, clinical neuroscience, and corporate AI development are dissolving, creating hybrid funding mechanisms that specifically target the intersection of these domains.

This report provides an exhaustive, strategic analysis of the global and national funding ecosystem available to Dr. Chang in the 2025–2026 cycle. The analysis is derived from a forensic review of current grant calls, historical funding data from peer publications, and the specific strategic mandates of philanthropic and governmental bodies. The central thesis of this report is that Dr. Chang’s research portfolio—characterized by the rigorous mathematical formalization of phenomenology via Information Theory 1 and the experimental validation of these theories through neuroimaging 2—allows for a "triangulation strategy." This strategy involves simultaneously targeting **medical foundations** (by framing research as clinical biomarkers for disorders like schizophrenia), **theoretical physics funders** (by framing consciousness as a fundamental informational property), and **AI safety organizations** (by framing agency and sentience as existential variables in machine learning).

The University of Helsinki offers a distinct strategic advantage as a host institution. Finland’s funding ecosystem is exceptionally robust for early-career researchers, characterized by a high density of private foundations relative to population size, and a national research council that prioritizes internationalization and "bold" initiatives. However, navigating this ecosystem requires a nuanced understanding of the "hidden curriculum" of each funding body—the unwritten preferences for specific types of impact, methodological rigor, and collaborative structures. This report dissects these nuances, providing a detailed roadmap for securing the capital necessary to establish a world-class laboratory.

**2\. Forensic Analysis of the PI Profile and Strategic Alignment**

To construct a viable funding roadmap, one must first deconstruct the Principal Investigator's research identity to identify the "keywords" and "concepts" that trigger funding algorithms and reviewer interest. A detailed review of Dr. Chang's publication record 1 reveals three distinct "funding personas" that can be deployed depending on the target agency.

### **2.1 Persona A: The Theoretical Physicist of Mind**

This persona relies on the work involving **Information Closure Theory (ICT)**, **Causal Emergence**, and **Graph Theory**.1 The core narrative here is the "First Principles" approach. The research does not merely *correlate* brain states with experience; it attempts to *derive* the properties of consciousness (such as confinement and privacy) from the mathematical laws of information processing in thermodynamic systems.

* **Funding Keywords:** *Non-trivial Informational Closure (NTIC), Coarse-graining, Emergence, Fundamental Physics of Life, Mathematical Consciousness Science.*  
* **Target Sector:** High-risk/High-reward philanthropy (Tiny Blue Dot, FQXi) and "Excellence" government grants (ERC).

### **2.2 Persona B: The Experimental Neuroscientist**

This persona is grounded in the empirical work using **EEG/fMRI**, **Brain Oscillations (Delta band)**, and the **Sense of Agency**.2 The narrative shifts to "Ecological Validity" and "Mechanistic Explanation." The research translates abstract theories into observable neural correlates, specifically investigating how the brain constructs a model of self-causality.

* **Funding Keywords:** *Schizophrenia, Disorders of Consciousness, Neural Correlates, Sensorimotor Integration, Bayesian Inference, Clinical Biomarkers.*  
* **Target Sector:** Medical foundations (Sigrid Jusélius, Brain Foundation) and National Health Institutes.

### **2.3 Persona C: The AI Safety and Alignment Architect**

This is the most rapidly expanding persona, leveraging expertise in **Intrinsic Motivation**, **Deep Learning**, and **Program Synthesis**.2 The narrative here is "Existential Safety." If we can mathematically define the emergence of agency and consciousness in biological systems via ICT, we can apply these same metrics to Artificial Intelligence to detect, monitor, and align "Digital Sentience."

* **Funding Keywords:** *Agentic AI, Digital Sentience, Alignment, Intrinsic Motivation, Explainable AI (XAI), Human-AI Interaction.*  
* **Target Sector:** Tech corporate grants (Google, Sony, Microsoft) and Existential Risk philanthropy (Open Philanthropy, FLI).

**3\. The Finnish National Ecosystem: Establishing the Laboratory Foundation**

For a new PI at the University of Helsinki, securing national funding is the primary mechanism for establishing independence. The Finnish system is unique in Europe for the significant role played by tax-exempt private foundations, which often act as agile alternatives to the slower, more bureaucratic Research Council of Finland.

### **3.1 The Sigrid Jusélius Foundation: The Medical Gold Standard**

The Sigrid Jusélius Foundation represents the apex of private medical funding in Finland. Historically conservative, it prioritizes high-impact biomedical research. For a consciousness researcher, the challenge is to frame the work within the context of "medicine" rather than "psychology" or "philosophy."

Strategic Fit and Application Narrative:  
Dr. Chang’s research on the "Abnormal sense of agency in patients with schizophrenia" 2 acts as the critical bridge to this foundation. The application must aggressively pivot away from the hard problem of consciousness and focus on the clinical problem of agency. The narrative should argue that Information Closure Theory provides a quantifiable biomarker for the disintegration of the "self-model" observed in psychotic disorders. By measuring the degree of Non-Trivial Informational Closure (NTIC) in patient populations 2, the lab can offer a novel diagnostic tool.  
Specific Funding Instrument: Senior Researcher Grant  
This instrument is specifically designed for independent researchers at the Docent level or equivalent.3

* **Eligibility:** The applicant must be an independent researcher with a PhD. The snippet confirms Dr. Chang is a "Fellow at University of Helsinki" and "Assistant Professor" 2, which satisfies the independence criteria.  
* **Scope:** The grant supports the researcher's *group*. It can fund doctoral students, postdocs, and technical staff for a period of 1–3 years. Crucially, it typically does not cover the PI's own salary (which is assumed to be covered by the university), but it provides the essential capital to build a team.4  
* **Financial Mechanics:** The grant allows for 10% of the total sum (max €8,000) to be used for travel and congress costs.4 This is vital for maintaining the international networks (e.g., with Araya Inc. in Japan) that Dr. Chang relies upon.  
* **Deadline and Cycle:** The application period is rigidly set for **November 1 to November 30** annually.4 Decisions are announced in March of the following year.  
* **Operational Detail:** The foundation operates with strict fiscal periods (May 1 to April 30). Managing the cash flow of a Jusélius grant requires close coordination with the University of Helsinki’s grant services, particularly regarding the "Mela" insurance payments if personal grants are awarded to students.6

### **3.2 The Kone Foundation: The Home of Bold Initiatives**

If Sigrid Jusélius is the conservative medical pillar, the Kone Foundation is the radical interdisciplinary engine of the Finnish research landscape. Their explicit mandate is to fund "Bold Initiatives" that break traditional academic silos, particularly those combining **Science and Art**.7

Strategic Fit and Application Narrative:  
Dr. Chang’s profile is practically tailor-made for Kone. His work integrates Philosophy of Mind (phenomenology), Physics (information theory), and Computer Science (AI).1 Kone seeks projects that "renovate and invigorate the field".7 The strategy here should be to propose a project that visualizes the mathematics of consciousness. Using Graph Theory and Causal Emergence 2, the lab could collaborate with a data artist or a philosopher to create a "map of the subjective mind." This satisfies Kone's deep interest in "building dialogue" and "multilingualism" in science.8  
**Specific Funding Instrument: General Research Grant**

* **Scope:** Personal monthly grants or project grants for a team.  
* **Value:** The grant sizes are standardized based on career stage:  
  * **Grant 3 (Experienced Researcher/Adjunct Professor):** €3,500/month (€42,000/year).7 This level is appropriate for Dr. Chang as a PI.  
  * **Grant 1 (Doctoral Student):** €2,400/month (€28,800/year). This is an excellent mechanism to fund a PhD student who might be working on a high-risk theoretical aspect of ICT that medical foundations would reject.  
* **Eligibility:** Open to non-Finnish nationals working in Finland.7 This removes any barrier for international PIs.  
* **Deadline:** **September 1 to September 15** annually.8  
* **Evaluation Criteria:** The foundation values "boldness" over "safe" incremental science. A proposal here should emphasize the paradigm-shifting potential of Information Closure Theory—arguing that it replaces the materialist view of the brain with an informational view.1

### **3.3 The Instrumentarium Science Foundation: Technology and Methods**

The Instrumentarium Science Foundation occupies a specific niche focused on **medical technology**, **methods**, and **instruments**.9

Strategic Fit and Application Narrative:  
While Dr. Chang is a theorist, his work relies on "Neuroimaging" and "Deep Learning".2 The strategic angle here is Methodological Development. Instead of proposing to "study consciousness," the proposal should focus on "Developing Novel Information-Theoretic Algorithms for fMRI/EEG Signal Analysis." The narrative should highlight that current neuroimaging analysis methods (like standard functional connectivity) fail to capture causal emergence and informational closure. By developing a new software toolbox based on ICT, the lab provides a technology that serves the broader medical community.  
**Specific Funding Instrument: Instrufoundation Fellow Grant**

* **Prestige:** This is a high-value grant (approx. €100,000) intended to support a researcher’s independence.10  
* **Scope:** Can cover salary and research costs.  
* **Deadline:** **August 1 to September 15** annually.9  
* **Strategic Nuance:** The foundation recently reported a "record number of applications," particularly in the doctoral category.10 However, the "Silmu Grant" for innovators and "Fellow Grants" are distinct tracks. For a PI, the Fellow Grant or a Project Grant is the target. The review process takes place in October-November, with decisions in January.10

### **3.4 The Finnish Brain Foundation (Suomen Aivosäätiö)**

This foundation is smaller but highly targeted. It funds research on the brain and nervous system, with specific pools for "Alzheimer's," "Neurology," and "Psychiatry".11

Strategic Fit and Application Narrative:  
Dr. Chang’s publication regarding "Brain oscillations in the delta frequency band" and their link to "deep sleep and consolidation of declarative memory" 2 is the leverage point here. The Finnish Brain Foundation allocates specific funds for "Alzheimer's disease and other memory disorders" (€125,000 pool in 2025).11 A proposal investigating how Information Closure correlates with memory consolidation during sleep could access this specific funding pool.  
**Specific Funding Instrument: Research Grants**

* **Value:** Typically small, ranging from €2,000 to €15,000.11  
* **Utility:** These are "seed grants." They are perfect for purchasing a specific piece of high-performance computing hardware (e.g., a GPU for deep learning simulations) or funding a pilot data collection.  
* **Deadline:** **August 1 to August 31** annually.11  
* **Restriction:** The grant cannot be transferred to a third party and must be used within three years.12

### **3.5 The Research Council of Finland (Academy of Finland)**

The Research Council (formerly Academy of Finland) is the primary government funding agency. For a University of Helsinki PI, an "Academy Project" is the cornerstone of a mature lab.

Strategic Fit:  
The Research Council funds "scientific quality" and "international impact." Dr. Chang’s international background (Japan/Araya Inc.) and high-impact publications 2 are assets. The Council is currently emphasizing International Collaboration and High-Performance Computing (connected to the LUMI supercomputer in Finland).  
**Specific Funding Instrument: Academy Project Funding**

* **Value:** Significant, often €400,000–€600,000 over 4 years.  
* **Timing:** The major calls typically occur in the **Winter (January)** or **Autumn (September)**. Snippet 13 indicates a call closing in **January 2024**, suggesting the next major cycle relevant to Dr. Chang would be **Winter 2026 (closing Jan 2026\)** or **Autumn 2025**.  
* **Strategic Requirement:** The PI must dedicate significant time to the project. Salary for the PI is generally *not* covered (except for specific reasons like returning from abroad), but the grant covers the team.13

## ---

**4\. The Nordic and European Ecosystem: Scaling Up**

Once the national base is secured, the next concentric circle of funding is the Nordic region (NordForsk) and the European Union (Horizon Europe/ERC). These grants are larger and require consortium building.

### **4.1 NordForsk: The Nordic Added Value**

NordForsk funds research that demonstrates "Nordic Added Value"—research that is more effective when conducted jointly by Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland than by any single country alone.

Strategic Opportunity: Nordic Research Networks  
NordForsk frequently issues calls for "Research Networks in Natural Sciences and Engineering".14

* **Goal:** To establish networking, workshops, and Ph.D. courses.  
* **Fit:** Dr. Chang needs to build a "Nordic Consciousness Network." Potential partners could include the *Karolinska Institutet* in Sweden (Cognitive Neuroscience) and the *University of Oslo* in Norway (Centre for Philosophy and the Sciences).  
* **Deadline:** Historical data suggests deadlines in **August** (e.g., August 14, 2025).15  
* **Funding:** Up to NOK 2 million (approx €170k) for networking activities. This is excellent for establishing the consortium needed for a future ERC Synergy or Horizon Europe grant.

Strategic Opportunity: Responsible AI Calls  
NordForsk recently awarded NOK 300 million for "Responsible use of AI".16

* **Fit:** Dr. Chang’s work on **AI Agency** and **Intrinsic Motivation** is directly relevant to "Responsible AI." If an AI has intrinsic motivation, it has *agency*. Controlling that agency is a matter of responsibility.  
* **Strategy:** Monitor NordForsk for the next wave of these calls (often in collaboration with the Baltic states). A project titled "Nordic Framework for Agentic AI Safety" would be highly competitive.

### **4.2 The European Research Council (ERC): The Career Definer**

The ERC Starting Grant is the single most prestigious grant for an early-career researcher in Europe. It offers 5 years of unrestricted funding (€1.5 million) and total scientific autonomy.

Strategic Fit and Panel Selection:  
Dr. Chang’s profile sits on the border of panels. He could apply to PE6 (Computer Science/AI) or SH4 (The Human Mind and Its Complexity).18

* **The Narrative:** The ERC demands "High Risk / High Gain." Incremental science is rejected. Dr. Chang must propose **Information Closure Theory (ICT)** not just as a theory, but as a *paradigm shift* in understanding the physical basis of biological intelligence.  
* **Precedent:** The field of consciousness is increasingly successful at the ERC. **Anil Seth** (University of Sussex) won an ERC Advanced Grant for "Computational Neurophenomenology" 18, and **Liad Mudrik** (Tel Aviv) won one for "IndUncon" (Unconscious processing).18 These precedents prove that the ERC funds rigorous consciousness science.  
* **Deadline:** The call for **ERC Starting Grant 2026** is expected to close on **October 14, 2025**.19  
* **Eligibility:** Researchers 2–7 years post-PhD. Based on Dr. Chang’s profile as a "Doctor of Philosophy Fellow," he is likely in the prime of this eligibility window.

### **4.3 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA): Recruitment Strategy**

While Dr. Chang is a PI, the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship is a recruitment tool.

* **Mechanism:** Dr. Chang acts as the **Host Supervisor**. A postdoc from abroad (e.g., Japan, UK, USA) applies with Dr. Chang.  
* **Benefit:** If successful, the EU pays 100% of the postdoc’s salary and research costs. It costs Dr. Chang nothing but time.  
* **Deadline:** **September 10, 2025**.21  
* **Strategy:** Dr. Chang should advertise immediately for a "MSCA Candidate in Computational Consciousness" to join his lab. The University of Helsinki usually provides "Masterclasses" to help these candidates write the proposal.

**5\. The Philanthropic Frontier: Global Consciousness Funding**

A unique feature of consciousness science is the existence of high-net-worth foundations specifically dedicated to the "Big Questions" that government agencies often find too speculative. This is the "grain" of funding that fits Dr. Chang perfectly.

### **5.1 The Tiny Blue Dot Foundation: The "Perception Box"**

This is currently the most dynamic and high-value target in the field. Founded by Elizabeth Koch, it focuses on the "Perception Box"—the cognitive schemas that limit our reality.

Strategic Alignment:  
Dr. Chang’s Information Closure Theory (ICT) is mathematically isomorphic to the "Perception Box" concept. ICT argues that conscious experience is closed off from the environment at a specific coarse-grained scale.1

* **The Pitch:** Dr. Chang should propose ICT as the *mathematical definition* of the Perception Box. The project would aim to "measure the walls of the box" using neuroimaging data.  
* **Grant Instrument:** **Perception Box Research Grant**.  
  * **Value:** Up to **$900,000** over 3 years.24  
  * **Deadline:** Letter of Intent (LOI) opens **September 2, 2025** and closes **October 7, 2025**.24  
* **Eligibility:** Open globally to non-profits and universities. The University of Helsinki is eligible.

### **5.2 The Templeton World Charity Foundation (TWCF)**

TWCF has been the primary driver of the "Accelerating Research on Consciousness" (ARC) initiative, which funds "Adversarial Collaboration".26

Strategic Alignment:  
TWCF explicitly funds projects that test conflicting theories.

* **The Strategy:** Dr. Chang should identify a proponent of a rival theory (e.g., **Integrated Information Theory \- IIT** or **Global Workspace Theory \- GWT**) and propose an adversarial collaboration to test a specific prediction where ICT differs from IIT. Snippet 43 shows that Templeton funds exactly this type of work (e.g., the Cogitate consortium).  
* **Registered Reports:** TWCF also funds smaller grants ($15,000 \- $50,000) for "Registered Reports" via the Center for Open Science.26 This is an excellent way to fund a specific, rigorous experiment with a high probability of success.

### **5.3 Foundational Questions Institute (FQXi)**

FQXi funds research at the intersection of physics, cosmology, and consciousness.29

Strategic Alignment:  
They are interested in "Agency," "The Observer," and "Quantum Biology."

* **Current Opportunity:** FQXi often runs essay competitions and grant rounds. The snippet 30 highlights a **"How Quantum is Life?"** essay competition with a deadline of **September 29, 2025**.  
* **Zenith Grants:** These are large project grants ($200k+). Past winners include major consciousness researchers like Giulio Tononi.32 Dr. Chang should monitor FQXi for the next "Consciousness in the Physical World" call.

### **5.4 Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP)**

HFSP funds "frontier" life sciences and *requires* intercontinental collaboration.33

**Strategic Alignment:**

* **Instrument:** **Young Investigator Grant**.  
* **Eligibility:** A team of PIs, all within 5 years of their independent position.  
* **Requirement:** The team must span continents (e.g., Europe \+ Asia \+ North America).  
* **Strategy:** Dr. Chang (Finland) is perfectly positioned to lead a team including his former colleagues at **Araya Inc. (Japan)** and a partner in the **USA**. This structure (Finland-Japan-USA) fits the HFSP mandate perfectly.  
* **Deadline:** The Letter of Intent (LOI) deadline is typically in **March** (e.g., March 18, 2025).33

## ---

**6\. The Corporate Frontier: AI and Tech Research Awards**

Dr. Chang’s expertise in **Applied Artificial Intelligence** and **Deep Learning** 2 allows him to access corporate funding that pure neuroscientists cannot.

### **6.1 Sony Research Award Program**

Sony Computer Science Laboratories (Sony CSL) has a long history of funding consciousness research (e.g., Ken Mogi, Jun Rekimoto).35

* **Instrument:** **Faculty Innovation Award** ($100k) or **Focused Research Award** ($150k).36  
* **Deadline:** **September 15, 2025**.  
* **Topics:** "Affective Computing," "Human Sensing," "Brain Science," "Human-AI Interaction".36  
* **Strategy:** Propose using **ICT** to measure "presence" or "agency" in VR environments, or to quantify "affect" in Human-AI interaction. This aligns with Sony's interests in entertainment technology and their "Cybernetic Intelligence" division.

### **6.2 Google Research Scholar Program**

This program is specifically for early-career faculty (up to 7 years post-PhD).37

* **Value:** Up to **$60,000** (unrestricted gift).  
* **Deadline:** **January 27, 2025**.37  
* **Focus:** Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction.  
* **Strategy:** Frame the research around **Explainable AI (XAI)**. Can Information Closure Theory be used to explain *why* a Deep Learning model made a decision? This is a massive area of interest for Google.

### **6.3 Amazon Research Awards (ARA)**

* **Focus:** **AWS Agentic AI**.38  
* **Deadline:** **November 2025**.39  
* **Strategy:** Dr. Chang’s work on "Intrinsic Motivation" and "Sense of Agency" is the academic equivalent of "Agentic AI." He should propose a method for programming robust, safe agency into AWS-based AI agents.

## ---

**7\. The Emerging Niche: AI Safety and Digital Sentience**

There is a rapidly growing pool of funding focused on the risks of **Advanced AI**, specifically the risk of creating suffering digital minds ("Digital Sentience") or uncontrollable agents.

### **7.1 Open Philanthropy & Longview Philanthropy**

These organizations are aligned with the Effective Altruism (EA) movement and fund high-impact research on existential risk.

* **Longview Digital Sentience Consortium:** This fund explicitly calls for "Proposing computational correlates of consciousness" and "Measuring consciousness in computational systems".40  
  * **Fit:** This is a perfect match for ICT. Dr. Chang can propose ICT as the *metric* for digital sentience.  
  * **Deadline:** Rolling/July.40  
* **Open Philanthropy:** Funds "AI Governance" and "AI Safety".41 Projects that help "understand the scientific trajectory of AI" or "mitigate catastrophic risks" are eligible.

### **7.2 Future of Life Institute (FLI)**

FLI focuses on reducing existential risks from powerful technologies.

* **Call:** **Grants for AI Safety and Public Engagement**.  
* **Deadline:** **February 4, 2025** (LOI).42  
* **Strategy:** Dr. Chang’s work on "Causal Emergence" is relevant here. If agency *emerges* in complex AI systems in ways we cannot predict (informational closure), that is a safety risk. A proposal to "Model the Emergence of Unintended Agency in Large Models" would be highly relevant.

## ---

## ---

**9\. Conclusion**

Dr. Acer Chang is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the current funding environment. By possessing a "bilingual" fluency in both **biological neuroscience** and **computational AI**, he can bypass the funding bottlenecks that restrict purely biological or purely theoretical researchers.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate Action:** Apply for the **Google Research Scholar** (Jan 27\) and **Future of Life** (Feb 4\) grants immediately. These are low-overhead applications that yield high prestige.  
2. **The "Big Fish":** Focus the bulk of the year’s writing effort on the **ERC Starting Grant** (Oct) and the **Tiny Blue Dot Foundation** (Oct). These are the "lab-making" grants.  
3. **Local Stability:** Secure a **Sigrid Jusélius** or **Kone** grant to demonstrate local viability to the University of Helsinki administration.  
4. **Network Activation:** Leverage the Japanese connection (Araya) to unlock **HFSP** and **Sony** funding, which require international or specific industry links.

This comprehensive portfolio approach ensures that the laboratory is not dependent on a single source of capital, securing its operation through the 2025–2026 cycle and beyond.
