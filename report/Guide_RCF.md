*   **Work Package Leaders:** Lead specific research themes within the consortium.
*   **Principal Investigators:** Lead research at individual partner organizations.
*   **Interaction Coordinators:** Dedicated roles for stakeholder engagement.

---

### 7.3 Two-Stage Application Process

| Stage | Timeline | Deliverable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage 1: Letter of Intent (LOI)** | Typically Spring (e.g., March-April) | 5-10 page summary of consortium, research vision, and interaction plan |
| **LOI Decision** | ~2 months after deadline | Invitation to submit full proposal |
| **Stage 2: Full Proposal** | Typically Summer (e.g., June-August) | Complete research plan, budget, CVs, detailed interaction plan |
| **Full Proposal Decision** | ~4 months after deadline | Funding decision |
| **Funding Start** | Typically January of following year | 3-year initial period begins |

---

### 7.4 The Interaction Plan (Critical Requirement)

The **Interaction Plan** is a mandatory component that distinguishes SRC funding from traditional research grants. It describes how research will be communicated and utilized by societal stakeholders.

#### Required Elements

1.  **Stakeholder Mapping:** Identify all relevant knowledge users (ministries, companies, NGOs, patient groups, etc.).
2.  **Engagement Strategy:** How will stakeholders be involved throughout the research process (not just at the end)?
3.  **Communication Plan:** Publications, policy briefs, media engagement, public events.
4.  **Impact Pathways:** Clear description of how research results will translate into policy, practice, or societal change.
5.  **Dedicated Resources:** Budget allocation for interaction activities (typically 5-15% of total budget).

#### Common Pitfalls

*   Treating interaction as an afterthought or "dissemination" at project end.
*   Listing stakeholders without concrete engagement mechanisms.
*   Underbudgeting interaction activities.

### 7.5 Strategic Advice for Forming SRC Consortia

1.  **Start Early:** Consortium building takes 6-12 months. Identify partners well before the call opens.
2.  **Diversify Disciplines:** Include humanities/social sciences alongside natural sciences and engineering.
3.  **Engage Stakeholders from Day One:** Involve policymakers and practitioners in proposal development.
4.  **Leverage HCAS:** Your Helsinki Collegium affiliation provides credibility for interdisciplinary, societally engaged research.
5.  **Frame Consciousness Research Strategically:**
    *   For **MIND:** Emphasize mental health applications (disorders of awareness, subjective well-being).
    *   Position AI Agency as relevant to **digital autonomy** and **algorithmic governance**.
