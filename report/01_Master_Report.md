# Comprehensive Funding Landscape Report

## Neuroscience, AI, and Consciousness Science

**University of Helsinki | 2025-2026**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The funding landscape for research at the intersection of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and consciousness science presents a unique three-tiered ecosystem that offers distinct advantages and strategic opportunities for Finnish researchers. This report synthesizes patterns across **Finnish local foundations**, **European Union programs**, and **global philanthropic organizations** to reveal a comprehensive strategic framework.

### The Three-Tiered Funding Ecosystem

**Finnish Local Foundations** represent a distinctive competitive advantage, operating with exceptional autonomy and a willingness to fund "blue-sky" interdisciplinary research that would face rejection in more risk-averse funding environments. The foundation ecosystem—led by Kone, Jane and Aatos Erkko, Finnish Cultural Foundation, and Sigrid Jusélius—provides rapid turnaround times, high success rates for Finnish researchers, and explicit support for unconventional science at the arts-science intersection.

**European Programs** (Horizon Europe, ERC, FENS) offer massive scale and consortium-based funding, but require sophisticated coordination and transnational partnerships. The European landscape is pivoting from "Brain Research" to "Brain Health," emphasizing societal impact, prevention, and resilience over pure mechanistic mapping. The "Human-Centric AI" narrative has permeated digital funding calls, creating lucrative openings for consciousness researchers who can frame their work as investigating machine agency and human cognitive liberty.

**Global Consciousness Funders** (Templeton, Tiny Blue Dot, Bial, Fetzer Franklin) represent a niche but high-value layer of specialized philanthropy dedicated to "Big Questions" that public agencies often deem too speculative. These funders are actively moving towards "Adversarial Collaboration" models—funding rival labs to test conflicting theories—creating a high-stakes, high-reward environment for foundational research.

### Key Strategic Insights

1. **Portfolio Approach is Essential:** A singular reliance on traditional funding mechanisms is insufficient. Success requires balancing stable, lower-risk returns from large-scale public health grants (Horizon Europe) with high-growth potential from venture-capital-like philanthropic investments (Templeton, Tiny Blue Dot).
2. **The Finnish Advantage is Real:** The domestic private foundation ecosystem offers competitive advantages virtually unmatched globally. Unlike hyper-competitive federal systems in the US or UK, Finnish foundations operate with tax-free beneficence that allows genuine "blue-sky" inquiry, with at least 75% of grants (in cases like Sigrid Jusélius) reserved for Finnish researchers.
3. **Interdisciplinarity is Mandatory, Not Optional:** Across all three tiers, successful proposals must integrate multiple dimensions—not simply applying AI to neuroscience data, but connecting neuroscience, AI, and consciousness with societal implications, artistic research methods, or philosophical frameworks.
4. **Methodological Rigor is Becoming a Core Requirement:** The replication crisis has prompted funders to actively enforce higher standards. Initiatives like Templeton's partnership with Center for Open Science ($1.125M for Registered Reports) signal that methodological innovations are transitioning from niche preference to core requirement, especially in scientifically contested fields like consciousness research.
5. **Timing and Coordination Create Multiplier Effects:** Strategic deadline coordination allows researchers to use smaller Finnish foundation grants as "bridge funding" or pilot phases for larger European consortium proposals, creating a cascading funding strategy.

## 2. Big Picture: Common Patterns Across Geographic Levels

### 2.1 Funding Philosophies & Strategic Approaches

The three geographic levels operate with fundamentally different philosophies that shape their funding priorities, risk appetites, and expected outcomes. Understanding these philosophical differences is critical for strategic proposal development.

#### Finnish Local: Foundation-Driven Autonomy

Finnish foundations operate with a degree of autonomy and tax-free beneficence that enables genuine "blue-sky" inquiry. The philosophy emphasizes:

- **High Autonomy:** Unlike public funding systems constrained by political priorities, Finnish foundations can fund unconventional, high-risk theoretical work
- **Arts-Science Intersection:** Explicit mandate for multidisciplinary work combining art and research (Kone Foundation's "multi-voiced" criterion)
- **Rapid Decision-Making:** Turnaround times of less than three months (Kone Foundation: September submission, December decision) compared to 6-12 months for European programs
- **Finnish Connection Requirement:** Projects must demonstrate connection to Finland, but this creates a protected market with significantly higher success rates for Finnish researchers
- **Long-Term Support:** Willingness to fund 3-5 year projects with substantial budgets (Jane and Aatos Erkko: €500k+ projects, some reaching €9M for center-scale initiatives)

**Strategic Implication:** Finnish foundations are ideal for launching high-risk pilot projects, securing "bridge funding" between larger grants, and developing interdisciplinary frameworks that can later be scaled through European or global programs.

#### European: Consortium-Based Scale

European funding operates through structured, large-scale frameworks that prioritize:

- **Consortium Requirements:** Most Horizon Europe calls mandate transnational partnerships (minimum 3 countries), creating both opportunity and coordination challenges
- **Societal Impact Focus:** Shift from "Brain Research" to "Brain Health" emphasizes resilience, prevention, and population-level outcomes over pure mechanistic discovery
- **Structured Clusters:** Organized into thematic clusters (Cluster 1: Health, Cluster 4: Digital/Industry/Space) that create predictable funding pathways
- **Innovation Translation:** Strong emphasis on pathways from basic research to applied innovation and commercialization
- **Scale and Duration:** Projects typically €1M-€5M+ over 3-5 years, requiring sophisticated project management

**Strategic Implication:** European programs provide the scale necessary for breakthrough AI-neuroscience research requiring large datasets, expensive equipment, or extensive international collaboration. However, they require early consortium-building (often 6-12 months before deadlines) and strong administrative support.

#### Global: Niche Philanthropy for "Big Questions"

Global consciousness funders operate with a distinct philosophy:

- **"Big Questions" Focus:** Explicitly funds research that public agencies deem too speculative or foundational
- **High-Risk, High-Reward:** Willingness to fund radical hypotheses (e.g., "quantum consciousness," "non-local consciousness") that would be rejected by peer review panels in traditional systems
- **Adversarial Collaboration:** Emerging model of funding rival labs to test conflicting theories, creating competitive but scientifically rigorous environments
- **Methodological Innovation:** Active promotion of new research paradigms (Registered Reports, open science mandates) as solutions to replication crises
- **Interdisciplinary Mandate:** Strong preference for work at the intersection of science, philosophy, and sometimes spirituality

**Strategic Implication:** Global funders offer the highest-value opportunities for consciousness-specific research (up to $900k from Tiny Blue Dot, $20M contests from Templeton), but require precise alignment with their specific frameworks (e.g., "Perception Box" terminology for Tiny Blue Dot, "Big Questions" framing for Templeton).

---

### 2.2 Common Themes Across All Levels

Despite their different philosophies, all three geographic levels converge on several key themes that represent universal priorities for successful funding applications.

#### Interdisciplinarity (Neuroscience + AI + Consciousness)

Across all tiers, successful proposals must integrate multiple dimensions:

- **Finnish Level:** Kone Foundation explicitly requires "multi-voiced" projects combining art and research; Jane and Aatos Erkko funds technology-medicine intersections
- **European Level:** Horizon Europe Cluster 4 calls for "Human-Centric AI" while Cluster 1 addresses "Brain-Computer Interfaces," requiring integration of digital technologies with neuroscience
- **Global Level:** Templeton funds "interdisciplinary approaches" to consciousness; Tiny Blue Dot explicitly supports AI and VR as interventions for expanding the "Perception Box"

**Pattern:** Proposals that simply apply AI to neuroscience data are insufficient. Successful applications connect neuroscience, AI, and consciousness with a third dimension—societal implications, artistic research methods, philosophical frameworks, or clinical translation.

#### Methodological Rigor and Reproducibility

The replication crisis has prompted a unified response across all funding levels:

- **Finnish Level:** While less explicit, foundations increasingly value open science practices and methodological transparency
- **European Level:** Horizon Europe emphasizes "responsible research and innovation" with open science mandates
- **Global Level:** Templeton's $1.125M partnership with Center for Open Science promotes Registered Reports model; Fetzer Franklin Fund explicitly supports work that "re-examines the foundations of science, including scientific methodologies"

**Pattern:** Methodological rigor is transitioning from optional preference to core requirement, especially in contested fields like consciousness research. Proposals must demonstrate commitment to transparency, preregistration, and reproducible methods.

#### Translation from Basic to Applied Research

All levels emphasize pathways from fundamental discovery to practical application:

- **Finnish Level:** Business Finland's "Research to Business" program (80% funding, 40% must be commercialization preparation) bridges academic research to market
- **European Level:** Horizon Europe's innovation actions and the shift to "Brain Health" emphasize prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutic applications
- **Global Level:** Tiny Blue Dot funds "interventions" (mindfulness, psychedelics, AI, VR) designed to expand perception; Templeton's "Human Flourishing" theme connects consciousness research to well-being outcomes

**Pattern:** Even foundational research must articulate potential pathways to impact—whether clinical (disorders of consciousness diagnostics), technological (brain-computer interfaces), or societal (AI ethics, mental health interventions).

#### International Collaboration

Cross-border partnerships are valued across all levels, though with different requirements:

- **Finnish Level:** Foundations value international partnerships as signals of excellence (Jane and Aatos Erkko explicitly supports "internationalization"), but Finnish researchers maintain primary roles
- **European Level:** Consortium requirements mandate international collaboration (minimum 3 EU/associated countries)
- **Global Level:** International eligibility is standard (Finnish researchers explicitly eligible for Templeton, Tiny Blue Dot, Bial, Fetzer), but proposals benefit from demonstrating global relevance

**Pattern:** International collaboration serves different functions: for Finnish foundations, it validates excellence; for European programs, it's mandatory; for global funders, it demonstrates broad relevance of "Big Questions."

#### Early-Career Support Mechanisms

All levels provide specific pathways for early-career researchers:

- **Finnish Level:** Sigrid Jusélius supports "young group leaders"; Finnish Cultural Foundation has early-career specific grants; Academy of Finland Research Fellowships
- **European Level:** ERC Starting Grants (2-7 years post-PhD); FENS travel grants for early-career neuroscientists
- **Global Level:** Mind & Life Varela Grants (up to $25k for graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty); Templeton fellowships for mid-career pivots into consciousness studies

**Pattern:** Early-career researchers have dedicated pathways at each level, but must align with career stage requirements (e.g., ERC Starting Grants have strict post-PhD year limits).

---

### 2.3 Application Patterns & Strategic Considerations

Successful funding strategies require understanding how application patterns differ across geographic levels and how to coordinate them for maximum effect.

#### Portfolio Approach: Balancing Stable vs. High-Risk Funding

The most successful researchers adopt a diversified portfolio strategy:

- **Stable Foundation (Finnish):** Use domestic foundations for core lab operations, pilot studies, and "bridge funding" between larger grants. These provide rapid turnaround and high success rates.
- **Scale Engine (European):** Target Horizon Europe and ERC for large-scale, long-duration projects requiring consortium coordination and substantial budgets.
- **Breakthrough Catalyst (Global):** Leverage consciousness-specific funders for high-risk, high-reward projects that establish intellectual leadership and generate publications in top-tier venues.

**Strategic Pattern:** The portfolio should mirror financial investment strategies—60-70% in stable Finnish/EU funding for sustainability, 20-30% in high-risk global opportunities for breakthrough potential, with continuous rebalancing based on success rates and research phase.

#### Timing and Deadline Coordination

Strategic deadline coordination creates multiplier effects:

- **Finnish Foundation Timing:** Kone (September), Sigrid Jusélius (November), Finnish Cultural Foundation (multiple rounds) provide predictable annual cycles
- **European Timing:** Horizon Europe calls typically open in late fall/early winter with spring deadlines; ERC has annual fall deadlines
- **Global Timing:** Varies widely—Tiny Blue Dot (October LOI, March full proposal), Templeton (August OFI, January full proposal), Bial (biennial, typically spring)

**Strategic Pattern:** Use Finnish foundation grants (3-month turnaround) as pilot funding to generate preliminary data for larger European proposals (6-12 month lead time). Global consciousness funders often have longer cycles (12-18 months) that can be coordinated with European timelines.

#### Proposal Framing Strategies for Different Funder Types

Each geographic level requires distinct narrative approaches:

- **Finnish Foundations:** Emphasize connection to Finland, societal impact, and interdisciplinary creativity. Use storytelling approaches (Kone values "compelling stories about why this matters to the human condition"). Highlight working groups and collaborative dimensions.
- **European Programs:** Frame as addressing major societal challenges with clear pathways to impact. Emphasize consortium strength, international collaboration, and innovation potential. Use structured formats aligned with work program priorities.
- **Global Funders:** Align with specific frameworks and terminology (e.g., "Perception Box" for Tiny Blue Dot, "Big Questions" for Templeton). Emphasize foundational significance, methodological innovation, and potential to transform the field. Highlight contrarian or unconventional aspects that traditional funders would reject.

**Strategic Pattern:** Develop modular proposal components that can be adapted across funder types, but recognize that successful framing requires funder-specific narratives, not generic templates.

#### Eligibility Patterns and Competitive Advantages

Understanding eligibility creates strategic advantages:

- **Finnish Advantage in Local:** Sigrid Jusélius reserves 75% of grants for Finnish researchers; all Finnish foundations require Finland connection, creating protected market with higher success rates
- **EU Access in European:** Finnish researchers have full access to Horizon Europe and ERC as EU member state, but must compete internationally; consortium-building skills become critical differentiator
- **International Openness in Global:** Finnish researchers are explicitly eligible for all major global consciousness funders, but compete globally; success requires demonstrating unique perspective or methodological advantage

**Strategic Pattern:** Leverage Finnish advantage for foundation funding (higher success rates), use EU access for scale and consortium opportunities, and position global applications by highlighting unique Finnish/European perspective on consciousness research that differentiates from US-dominated field.

---

## Conclusion

The funding landscape for neuroscience, AI, and consciousness research operates as an integrated three-tiered ecosystem. Finnish foundations provide the stable foundation and rapid-turnaround pilot funding. European programs offer the scale and consortium infrastructure for large-scale breakthroughs. Global consciousness funders deliver the high-risk, high-reward opportunities for foundational discoveries.

The most successful researchers will not treat these as separate funding silos, but as an integrated portfolio where each tier serves distinct strategic functions. By understanding the common themes that unite all three levels—interdisciplinarity, methodological rigor, translation pathways, international collaboration, and early-career support—researchers can develop proposals that resonate across geographic boundaries while leveraging the unique advantages of each tier.

The strategic imperative is clear: adopt a portfolio approach that balances stability with breakthrough potential, coordinate timing to create cascading funding effects, and frame proposals with funder-specific narratives while maintaining core interdisciplinary excellence. For Finnish researchers at the intersection of neuroscience, AI, and consciousness science, this three-tiered ecosystem offers unprecedented opportunities—but only for those who understand and strategically navigate its patterns.

## 3. Finnish Local Funding: Detailed Analysis

The Finnish funding landscape is bifurcated into high-autonomy **Private Foundations** and impact-driven **Public Funding Agencies**. Understanding the operational differences between these two sectors is key to a successful "portfolio approach."

---

### 3.1 Private Foundations: The "Blue-Sky" Ecosystem

Private foundations in Finland are characterized by their high degree of autonomy, tax-free grant structures, and willingness to fund speculative or interdisciplinary research that might not fit the rigid criteria of state-funded calls. This "Blue-Sky" ecosystem provides essential "breathing room" for researchers to pursue high-risk, high-reward inquiries that fall outside national strategic priorities.

The ecosystem is defined by three core pillars:

1. **High Autonomy:** Unlike public agencies, these foundations have the independence to fund "bold" projects deemed too speculative for state budgets.
2. **Tax-Free Grant Structures:** A unique feature is the ability to provide tax-exempt personal grants, which allows researchers to work outside of traditional university employment contracts.
3. **Interdisciplinary Mandate:** These foundations are the primary supporters of "artistic-scientific synthesis" and research that challenges conventional disciplinary boundaries.

#### 3.1.1 Kone Foundation (Koneen Säätiö)

**Relevance Score: 5/5**

The most significant private funder for research that challenges traditional disciplinary boundaries. It is uniquely positioned as the primary supporter for consciousness research that bridges neuroscience, AI, and the humanities.

* **Key Deadlines:** September 1–15 annually.
* **Strategic Focus:** "Multi-voicedness," boldness, and "Human Agency in the Age of AI."
* **Core Rationale:**
  * **Mandate for Boldness:** Actively seeks high-risk "Big Questions" that traditional public agencies often deem too speculative.
  * **Human Agency & AI:** A recurring funding priority is how algorithmic systems affect human autonomy and subjective experience (e.g., the "Citizen Agency in AI" theme).
  * **Narrative Impact:** Evaluations prioritize a compelling story about the human condition over rigid quantitative metrics.
* **Advice:** Focus on the "Bold Opening" (Rohkea avaus) category and avoid a purely technical "AI for data analysis" framing. Emphasize how the project interrogates what it means to be human in a digital age.

#### 3.1.2 Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation

**Relevance Score: 4/5 (Strong Match for Applied Research)**

The "engine of excellence" for high-capital, high-impact science and technology projects.

This section provides a tailored roadmap for a Principal Investigator establishing a new research group in Finland at the intersection of Computer Science, Neuroscience, and the Humanities (HCAS).

### 6.1 High-Priority Funding Roadmap

| Objective                         | Target Instrument                              | Strategic Framing                                                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lab Foundation**          | **Sigrid Jusélius:** Young Group Leader | Frame "Sense of Agency" or "ICT" as a**clinical diagnostic tool** for volition disorders. Use the 5-year (3+2) duration to establish permanent residency. |
| **Intellectual Leadership** | **Kone Foundation:** Bold Opening        | Leverage**HCAS affiliation** to propose "multi-voiced" projects bridging information theory and the philosophy of mind.                                   |
| **Technical Scaling**       | **Erkko Foundation:** Technology Board   | Use**Engineering/Industry background** to sell the project as "Hard Engineering" for AI Safety and Alignment benchmarks.                                  |
| **Personnel Recruitment**   | **Research Council:** Academy Project    | Propose empirical validation (EEG/MEG/TMS) of the**Information Closure Theory (ICT)** to fund PhD and Postdoc positions.                                  |

### 6.2 Competitive Differentiators for Finnish Context

* **The HCAS Advantage:** Affiliation with the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies signals high theoretical prestige to Finnish private foundations (Kone, SKR), which value "unhurried" and "foundational" inquiry.
* **Engineering Rigor:** A background in Engineering Science and industry AI (Japan) provides a rare "cross-over" appeal for technical funders (Erkko, Business Finland) who often find consciousness research too speculative.
* **Empirical Depth:** Proficiency in multiple neuroimaging modalities (EEG, MEG, TMS) allows for a "closed-loop" research narrative—moving from information-theoretical models (ICT) to rigorous biological testing.
* **Global-Local Bridge:** As a Taiwan-origin researcher with UK and Japan experience, the PI is uniquely positioned to lead **international consortia** (Horizon Europe), satisfying the "International Anchor" requirements of Finnish foundations.

### 6.3 Action Plan for 2026 Residency Goal

1. **Phase I (Immediate - Q1 2026):** Submit the **Erkko Technology** application focusing on AI Agency benchmarks (Critical window for May board decision). Begin gathering **pilot data** using UH neuroimaging facilities (EEG/MEG).
2. **Phase II (Spring/Summer 2026):** Target the **SKR Uusimaa Fund** for local impact projects. Establish **clinical collaborations** with Helsinki University Hospital (HUS) to ground theory in medical utility.
3. **Phase III (Autumn 2026):** Submit the **"Young Group Leader"** bid to **Sigrid Jusélius** (Nov 1-30) and the **"Bold Opening"** bid to **Kone** (Sep 1-15) to secure long-term group funding and institutional permanence. Frame the Jusélius bid as a 5-year clinical translation project.
