## 4. Pillar II: Global Challenges & Industrial Competitiveness

Pillar II addresses major societal challenges through collaborative research projects.

### 4.0 Career Stage Fit: When to Apply for Pillar II

**Critical Assessment for New PIs:**

| Career Stage | Pillar II Fit | Strategic Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Year 1 as PI (New Group)** | **2/5 (Not Ideal)** | Focus on individual grants first (ERC Consolidator, Academy Project) |
| **Years 2-3 as PI** | **4/5 (Good Fit)** | Start building consortia, apply as Work Package Leader or Partner |
| **Years 4+ as PI** | **5/5 (Excellent)** | Can coordinate consortia, strong track record attracts partners |

**Why Pillar II is Challenging for Year 1 PIs:**

1. **Consortium Building Takes Time:** Finding 3-15 partners, aligning interests, and negotiating roles requires **6-12 months** of networking and relationship building.
2. **Reputation Factor:** Established PIs are more likely to be invited as partners. As a new PI, you may not yet have the visibility or track record to attract strong consortium partners.
3. **Time Investment:** Pillar II proposals are **50-70 pages** and require extensive coordination. In Year 1, your time is better spent on:
   - Establishing your research group
   - Securing individual grants (ERC Consolidator, Academy Project)
   - Building your track record
4. **Lower Success Rate:** ~10-20% success rate means you need multiple attempts. Better to establish yourself first with higher-probability individual grants.

**Strategic Timeline for Pillar II:**

| Timeline | Action | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026 (Year 1)** | **Monitor calls, start networking** | Attend conferences, identify potential partners, but don't apply yet |
| **2027-2028 (Years 2-3)** | **Build consortia, apply as Partner** | With established group and track record, you're an attractive partner |
| **2029-2030 (Years 3-4)** | **Apply as Work Package Leader** | Strong track record allows you to lead significant work packages |

**What to Do Now (2026):**

1. **Focus on Individual Grants:** Prioritize ERC Consolidator (Jan 2027 deadline) and Academy Project (Oct 2026 deadline).
2. **Start Networking:** Attend European conferences (FENS, NeurIPS), join FCAI (if you join the Flagship), reach out to potential partners informally.
3. **Monitor Pillar II Calls:** Check Health & Digital cluster topics regularly, but treat them as **future opportunities** (2027-2028), not immediate targets.

**Bottom Line:** Pillar II is **highly relevant** to your research (Health & Digital clusters are 5/5), but it's better suited for **Years 2-3** as a PI, not Year 1. Use Year 1 to establish your group with individual grants, then scale up with Pillar II collaborative projects.

### 7.4 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1.  **Starting Too Late:** Horizon Europe applications require 6-12 months of preparation. Start **now**.
2.  **Weak Consortium:** Choose partners with complementary expertise, not just convenience.
3.  **Ignoring Impact:** Horizon Europe strongly emphasizes societal impact. Don't treat it as "pure science."
4.  **Missing Deadlines:** Deadlines are strict. Submit at least 24 hours early.
5.  **Underestimating Coordination:** Consortium projects require significant coordination effort.
