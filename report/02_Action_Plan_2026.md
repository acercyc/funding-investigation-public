    *   **2026 (Year 1 as PI):**
        *   **Monitor:** Watch the first call (June-September 2026) to understand requirements and evaluation criteria
        *   **Do NOT apply yet:** As a new PI, you need to establish your independent track record first
        *   **Focus on:** Building your group, publishing independent research, demonstrating transformative potential
    *   **2027-2028 (Years 2-3 as PI):**
        *   **Target:** Consider applying once you have:
            *   Established your research group
            *   Published high-impact independent research
            *   Demonstrated the transformative scope of your work (Information Closure Theory, AI Agency)
        *   **Framing:** Position your research as addressing a fundamental question requiring the scale/duration of ERC Plus (e.g., "A Unified Theory of Agency Across Biological and Artificial Systems")
*   **Key Challenge:** With only ~30 grants per year across **all fields**, you'll be competing against the most established researchers in Europe. This is more competitive than Synergy Grants.
*   **Your Fit:** Your "Information Closure Theory" and "AI Agency" research could qualify if framed as transformative, but you need a stronger independent track record first.
*   **Resources:** See `report/Guide_Horizon_Europe.md` Section 3.1 for detailed information.

#### 2.2 ERC Synergy Grant (Horizon Europe)
*   **Status:** **Challenging but Viable** — Consider for 2027 or 2028 call
