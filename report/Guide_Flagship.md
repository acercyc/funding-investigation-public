## 11. Flagship vs. Other Funding Instruments: Strategic Comparison

| Instrument | Scale | Duration | Application | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flagship** | €10M-50M+ | 8 years | Institutional consortium | Large-scale ecosystems, industry collaboration |
| **Academy Project** | €600k-1M | 4 years | Individual/consortium | Mid-scale research, team building |
| **Academy Research Fellowship** | €700k | 4 years | Individual | Early-career independence |
| **Centres of Excellence** | Multi-million | 8 years | Research group | World-leading research groups |
| **SRC Programme** | €1M-12M | 3-6 years | Multidisciplinary consortium | Societal challenges, policy impact |

**Strategic Insight:** Flagships are **ecosystem builders**, not just research projects. They require institutional commitment, industry engagement, and long-term vision. For individual researchers, the best strategy is to **join existing Flagships** rather than create new ones.
