**Acer Yu-Chan Chang** is a University Researcher at the Department of Computer Science and an Intelligent³ Research Fellow at the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies (HCAS) at the University of Helsinki.

### Background and Education

Originally from Taiwan, Acer completed his PhD at the University of Sussex in the UK under the supervision of Professors Anil Seth and Ryota Kanai. His academic foundation includes a Master's degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from National Yang Ming University and a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Science from National Cheng Kung University.

### Career Journey

After completing his PhD, Acer spent five years working at Araya Inc., an AI startup in Japan, where he continued his consciousness research while gaining industry experience in artificial intelligence and machine learning. He then returned to academia, serving as a Project Assistant Professor at the University of Tokyo and later as an Assistant Professor at Rikkyo University in Japan before moving to Helsinki in 2025.

### Current Position and Goals

As a Research Fellow at the University of Helsinki, Acer functions as a principal investigator, operating independently rather than as part of an existing lab or as a postdoc. Having just arrived in Finland, he is in the process of establishing his research group from the ground up. His current three-year position comes with institutional funding, though he does not yet have external grants.

Looking ahead, Acer is committed to building a strong foundation at the university with the goal of establishing a permanent presence in Finland. His priorities include recruiting lab members to form a collaborative research team and securing external funding to support long-term research initiatives. This foundational phase represents an important transition as he works to create a sustainable research environment for advancing his work in consciousness science, AI, and computational neuroscience.

### Research Focus

Acer's research centers on the scientific study of consciousness using theoretical, computational, and empirical approaches. He integrates cognitive neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and information theory to investigate how the brain constructs and maintains conscious experience.

His work spans a broad range of consciousness research topics. He developed the Information Closure Theory of Consciousness (ICT), which provides an information-theoretical framework for understanding the emergence of conscious processes. Beyond theoretical work, his research explores the sense of agency, investigating how it emerges from active causal inference and how individuals form action plans to infer their degree of control over their environment.

Another key focus of his research is artificial intelligence, particularly deep neural networks and in-context learning. His expertise in machine learning and AI, developed through both academic research and industry experience, informs his approach to understanding consciousness and building computational models of cognitive processes. His broader interests also include multi-agent systems, emergent phenomena, collective cognitive behavior, and the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience.

### Skills and Languages

Acer is proficient in Python, R, and Matlab, with expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and neuroscience methods including EEG, MEG, and TMS. He is fluent in Taiwanese, Mandarin Chinese, and English.
